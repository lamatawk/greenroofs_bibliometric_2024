TI The relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity: a
   systematic review
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB As a form of green infrastructure, green roofs can enhance urban biodiversity by providing complex vegetation structures, supplying increased foraging and roosting opportunities for animals and increasing habitat connectivity. Although it is widely believed that green roofs can promote urban biodiversity, this idea has not been widely studied on an empirical scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding of the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity from different perspectives is still lacking. Here we provide a systematic review of the empirical literature on the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity. The results suggest that green roofs benefit urban biodiversity to some extent but cannot replace quondam natural habitats or complex artificial greening environments. Additionally, the studies reviewed here focused primarily on the diversity of plants or arthropods and were conducted almost exclusively in the United States and the United Kingdom. Moreover, most studies investigating the factors of green roofs affecting biodiversity focused on roof area, height, age, substrate depth, and plant community. To improve our understanding of the relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity, more extensive research, particularly in developing countries, as well as more in-depth studies of a greater number of species and taxa, including chordates, mollusks and microbes, from different perspectives (e.g. at the genetic level) and other potential pathways are needed. In the future, the density, distribution pattern, distance and location relationship between different green roofs should be considered in an integrated manner. In order to more effectively support urban biodiversity, green roofs should be used in conjunction with other urban green spaces.

TI Biodiversity impact assessment of building's roofs based on Life Cycle
   Assessment methods
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB To fight against the biodiversity loss and to take advantage of ecosystem services that nature can offer, urban planners integrate green spaces in urban projects. However to assess green spaces, attention is generally paid to local biodiversity (i.e. "in situ") which concerns the plot on which buildings are constructed. The biodiversity impacted outside the construction site (i.e. "ex situ") which concerns the extraction of materials, transportation and waste, is rarely associated to the project assessment.
   In this study, two endpoint Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are applied: ReCiPe 2016 and Impact World + to assess a conventional roof and three different types of green roofs. As Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data about urban plants are missing, we created new data to model the vegetation layer of green roofs by collecting information nearby plants nursery.
   This work shows that 1) extensive green roof generates the least biodiversity loss, 2) "ex situ" biodiversity is 10 times more impacted than "in situ" biodiversity, 3) the impact of the vegetation layer on the biodiversity loss is significant.
   LCA methods do not enable to cover all pressures threatening biodiversity and they also lack precision to assess "in situ" biodiversity. Nevertheless, their main strength is to consider "ex situ" biodiversity along the value chain of the studied systems.
   Coupling LCA with ecological expertise should improve the assessment by taking into account local specificities and both negative and positive impacts of a system (e.g. "in situ" biodiversity gains with green roofs).

TI The role of green roofs as urban habitats for biodiversity modulated by
   their design: a review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB In view of the demographic revolution and the rapid development of urban environments, the installation of green roofs could be a tool to ensure human well-being (e.g. heat island reduction, rainwater management), or to increase urban biodiversity. However, the relationships between biodiversity and green roofs are not yet clear and little research has looked into this. We therefore reviewed studies on the overall biodiversity of green roofs. Our review has shown that there is a lack of knowledge of the biodiversity of green roofs, with recent consideration. We highlighted the importance of green roof contribution, in maintaining urban biodiversity through three lines of research: characterization, modes of use and design. Furthermore, we found that there were very few studies on soil biodiversity on this topic. We concluded that green roof construction guidelines should integrate soil communities into their design and aim to be heterogeneous at roof and landscape level. Future research should focus on the diversification and redundancy of rooftop conditions in the urban matrix. This would increase the area of green habitats and the success of species dispersal in cities.

TI More insect species are supported by green roofs near public gardens
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB Rapid urbanization is among the factors that decrease insect diversity. However, by offering suitable habitats, green roofs could lessen this adverse effect. Certain factors, like a nearby public garden, could be useful predictor variables to analyze to what extent green roofs can support insect communities. The study aimed to measure the insect diversity on intensive green roofs located near public gardens and on more isolated green roofs, within an urban setting. Insect species richness, abundance, and assemblages on the green roofs near public gardens differed from those on isolated green roofs. Results indicate that green roofs near public gardens will host more species, especially pollinators, consequently lessening urbanization's negative effect. To properly understand how landscape factors impact insect communities on green roofs, future studies on green roofs' biodiversity should consider public gardens and their influence on urban biodiversity.Implications for insect conservationThe planning and establishment of a green roof near public gardens would probably enhance biodiversity conservation in an urban setting.

TI Lessons from New York High Line Green Roof: Conserving Biodiversity and
   Reconnecting with Nature
SO URBAN SCIENCE
AB The concept of sustainable urban design has appeared in different perspectives to minimize and reduce the negative impacts of urban expansion in terms of climatic and environmental drawbacks. One of the undeniable approaches of sustainable urban design is the adoption of green urban roofs. Green roofs are seen to have a substantial role in addressing and resolving environmental issues in the context of climate change. Research investigations have indicated that green roofs have a remarkable impact on decreasing rainwater runoff, reducing the heat island effect in urban spaces, and increasing biodiversity. Nevertheless, green roofs in urban spaces as a competent alternative to nature remains a standing question. To what extent can green roofs mimic the biodiversity that is seen in nature? Moreover, to what level is this approach practical for achieving a tangible reconnection with nature, or so-called biophilia? This study attempts to discuss the essence and impact of green roofs in urban spaces based on a case study approach. The study reflected lessons from the New York High Line Green Roof regarding biophilia and biodiversity in this case study. It concludes with key lessons that can be transferred to other urban spaces with similar settings.

TI Urban green roofs promote metropolitan biodiversity: A comparative case
   study
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Urban green spaces can provide habitat and resources for urban dwelling fauna. Suburban green spaces occur most commonly as parks and roadside vegetation, but as human populations grow and space in cities becomes increasingly limited, space-efficient green solutions like green roofs and walls in metropolitan areas are becoming increasingly common. However, the efficacy of these forms of green infrastructure in attracting and promoting biodiversity remains limited. To address this, we compared arthropod, gastropod, and avian species richness and diversity between green and conventional roofs on neighbouring and identical buildings in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. By monitoring local biodiversity using motion sensing camera traps and regular insect surveys, we found that the green roof supported four times the avian, over seven times the arthropod, and twice the gastropod diversity of the conventional roof. Only the green roof attracted locally rare species including blue banded bees (Amegilla Cingulata) and metallic shield bugs (Scutiphora pedicellata). Our results suggest that green roofs, like other urban green spaces, can have ecological significance by attracting and supporting urban fauna that may then add important functional capacities to previously depauperate spaces. This study demonstrates the potential for the widespread adoption of green roofs to create more biologically diverse cities.

TI Contribution of green roofs to urban arthropod biodiversity in a
   Mediterranean climate: A case study in Valencia, Spain
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Studies on biodiversity on green roofs have been carried out in parallel to the degree to which these infrastructures have been implemented in different countries. There are no studies about biodiversity of fauna in these habitats in Spain and other countries of Mediterranean Europe, except France. This study compares the arthropod community of a green roof to that of a conventional flat roof with gravel covering and two ground-level gardens, in a geographical area where the territory is a matrix of urban and agricultural lands. The interest of the results is twofold: no such work is available in this Mediterranean region, and the stressful environmental conditions. No significant differences appeared for relative abundance, taxa richness, Shannon Index, and effective number of taxa between the studied habitats. However in taxa composition and abundance terms, the arthropod community on green roofs differed significantly from that of ground-level gardens, and exclusive species were captured in both habitats. The relative abundance of the different functional groups captured showed different seasonal patterns in ground level gardens and green roof. Our results also confirm that green roofs significantly increase biodiversity compared to conventional roofs. Thus, in the climate conditions of Mediterranean region, our study suggests that green roofs may also be suitable solutions to increase and improve the arthropods biodiversity in urban areas.

TI The contribution of constructed green infrastructure to urban
   biodiversity: A synthesis and meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB The development of buildings and other infrastructure in cities is viewed as a threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning because natural habitat is replaced. However, there is momentum for implementing green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, wetland detention basins and community gardens, that partially offset these impacts and that benefit human health. GI is often designed to explicitly support ecosystem services, including implied benefits to biodiversity. The effects of GI on biodiversity have been rarely quantified, but research on this topic has increased exponentially in the last decade and a synthesis of the literature is needed. Here, we examined 1,883 published manuscripts and conducted a meta-analysis on 33 studies that were relevant. We determined whether GI provides additional benefits to biodiversity over conventional infrastructure or natural counterparts. We also highlighted research gaps and identified opportunities to improve future applications. We determined that GI significantly improves biodiversity over conventional infrastructure equivalents, and that in some cases GI had comparable measures of biodiversity to natural counterparts. Many studies were omitted from these analyses because we found GI research has generally neglected conventional experimental design frameworks, including controls, replication or adequate sampling effort. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis identified that taxa specificity is an important consideration for green infrastructure (GI) design relative to the more common measurements at the community level. We also identified that ignoring multi-trophic interactions and landscape-level patterns can limit our understanding of GI effects on biodiversity. We recommend further examination of species-specific differences among infrastructures (i.e. green, conventional or natural equivalents) or using functional traits to improve the efficacy of GI implementation on urban biodiversity. Furthermore, we encourage policy makers and practitioners to improve the design of GI to benefit urban ecosystems because of the potential benefits for both humans and global biodiversity.

TI The water-sensitive city meets biodiversity: habitat services of rain
   water management measures in highly urbanized landscapes
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Urban water managers face numerous challenges, including limited natural resources for maintenance of technical infrastructure, changing demography, and dramatic environmental degradation. Although the vision of the "water-sensitive city" helps to develop tools and strategies toward more sustainable urban water systems, it does not consider biodiversity effects. We therefore aimed to determine habitat provision or habitat services provided by important rainwater management measures (e.g., ponds, swales, rain gardens, green roofs, green walls, permeable pavement), and to highlight how specific design and management practices for such measures enhance urban biodiversity. There is evidence of habitat services provided by rainwater management measures. Nevertheless, the categorization of such measures as civil engineering structures and their related rules limit efforts to optimize the biodiversity friendliness of design and management. The main factors to provide enhanced and more sustainable habitats are shaping design and maintenance according to target species and favoring connectivity by integrating rainwater management measures into the urban blue-green network. We find that strategic implementation of combinations of rainwater management measures into existing built-up areas allows greater multifunctionality of urban infrastructure. The "biodiversity-friendly and water-sensitive city" implies the efficient integration of ecological design measures in urban planning at building, neighborhood, and landscape scales.

TI Assessing the potential of strategic green roof implementation for green
   infrastructure: Insights from Sumida ward, Tokyo
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Urban green spaces, and green infrastructure more generally, provide multiple benefits that can enhance urban livability and sustainability. These range from the mitigation of air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effect, to multi-dimensional benefits to human wellbeing and biodiversity. However, the expansion of urban green spaces is not always feasible in many cities. In such urban contexts, there have been proposals to utilize rooftops as green roofs in order to gain some of these benefits. This study spatially identifies areas where roofs have the potential to provide different types of benefits associated with urban green spaces if they are retrofitted with green roofs. Through a GIS-based approach we catalogue available roof space in Sumida ward in Tokyo for green roof implementation, and subsequenlty evaluate the potential of each roof patch to offer four types of benefits if retrofitted with a green roof, namely UHI effect mitigation, air pollution mitigation, and benefits to subjective wellbeing and biodiversity. Approximately 25% of the total roof surface in Sumida ward can potentially be used for green roof implementation. Furthermore, about 5.2% and 59% of this area has a respectively high and moderate potential to provide all four benefits if retrofitted with green roofs. This could increase the extent of green spaces by 10% and 120% respectively across the Sumida ward. In this sense, green roofs can become a major element of green infrastructure with ripple positive effects for urban livability and sustainability through the provision of UHI effect and air pollution mitigation, and benefits to subjective wellbeing and biodiversity.

TI A multiple scale, function, and type approach to determine and improve
   Green Infrastructure of urban watersheds
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Green Infrastructure (GI) connects different types of green features via various scales, thereby supporting urban biodiversity and service provision. This study presents a methodology capable of identifying multiple functions to assess GI in less-developed countries, where such methodologies are lacking. GI was assessed based on a high resolution land use classification using both landscape metrics and spatial data within an urbanized region of San Jose', Costa Rica, at different scales (watershed, neighbourhood, object). Results showed highly fragmented green spaces (often < 10 ha), typically unable to support high levels of biodiversity, along with a low amount of green space per inhabitant (< 7.4 m(2)) within the watershed. Substantially higher tree cover (x6) and tree density (x5) were found in the greenest neighbourhood in comparison to the least green neighbourhood. Potential areas for new GI in the form of green roofs (4.03 ha), permeable pavement (27.3), and potential retention areas (85.3) were determined. Several green spaces (n = 11) were identified as promising GI sites with the potential to increase provision (18.6 m(2)/inhabitant). The adopted methodology demonstrates the potential of GI for increasing recreational green space access, runoff reduction, and flood retentions while supporting biodiversity, validating its utility in guiding decision-making and policy generation.

TI Biodiversity Impact of Green Roofs and Constructed Wetlands as
   Progressive Eco-Technologies in Urban Areas
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The total amount of sealed surfaces is increasing in many urban areas, which presents a challenge for sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants when extreme rainfall events occur. One promising solution approach is the application of decentralized eco-technologies for water management such as green roofs and constructed wetlands, which also have the potential to improve urban biodiversity. We review the effects of these two eco-technologies on species richness, abundance and other facets of biodiversity (e.g., functional diversity). We find that while green roofs support fewer species than ground-level habitats and thus are not a substitute for the latter, the increase in green roof structural diversity supports species richness. Species abundance benefits from improved roof conditions (e.g., increased substrate depth). Few studies have investigated the functional diversity of green roofs so far, but the typical traits of green roof species have been identified. The biodiversity of animals in constructed wetlands can be improved by applying animal-aided design rather than by solely considering engineering requirements. For example, flat and barrier-free shore areas, diverse vegetation, and heterogeneous surroundings increase the attractiveness of constructed wetlands for a range of animals. We suggest that by combining and making increasing use of these two eco-technologies in urban areas, biodiversity will benefit.

TI Analyzing the Efficiency of Increasing Suitable Habitat Area for
   <i>Paridae</i> by Roof Greening Method Based on Building Type: Case
   Study of Suwon City, Republic of Korea
SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB Owing to the proliferation of people in cities worldwide, the size of urban green areas has decreased along with biodiversity. Suwon City, a highly populated area adjacent to Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea, and the subject of this study, has been making significant efforts to prevent such a decrease in biodiversity. In this study, we aim to develop a suitable scenario for roof greening in Suwon City, analyze how the efficiency of increasing the suitable habitat area of the Paridae bird changes with the scenario, and propose the most efficient roof greening plan. For the development and application of this plan, public, commercial, and residential buildings were selected as target spaces to which roof greening was applied. Then, the appropriate roof greening area was determined (400000 m(2), which is 0.712% of the area of Suwon) with reference to the Roof Greening Promotion Plan of Seoul. Subsequently, roof greening types were classified into low, medium, and high management based on the cases of roof greening. We found that the increase in the habitat area of Paridae depended on the types of roof greening and construction building. The buildings with the highest efficiency of increasing the habitat area in Suwon City (an increase of 1197.5%) were all commercial buildings except for those with low management, while the buildings with the lowest efficiency (115%) were public buildings. The information on the increases in the habitat area of Paridae and the cost of roof greening per area (m(2)) for the three types of building can be used to establish suitable green roofs that will promote urban biodiversity.

TI One green roof type, one Technosol, one ecological community
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Green infrastructures play a key role in the functionality and resilience of urban ecosystems. The physical, including thickness, chemical and biological properties of the Technosols of green infrastructures on rooftops are highly variable, leading to more or less favourable conditions for soil biodiversity. The aim of this study was to investigate the abundance and diversity of bacteria, fungi, nematodes, collembola and plants communities in relation with abiotic parameters of Technosols on 12 productive and extensive green roofs of the Paris region (France). Results showed that green roofs harboured a high level of abundance and diversity from microorganisms to micro and mesofauna. Microbial biomass ranged between 16.3 and 419.8 mu g DNA g-1, with a predominance of bacteria, nematodes represented 820-60,700 individuals per kg of soil and between 1000 and 60,700 collembolan were present per m2 of soil. A total of 13,986 bacterial OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit), 33,559 fungal OTU, 47 Collembola species, 28 nematodes families, 16 cultivated plant species and 48 spontaneous plant species was identified on all the green roofs studied. Microbial, animals and plants communities were significantly different between the two types of green roofs. Productive and extensive rooftops represent contrasted habitats, which can strongly influence the soil biota. Any voluntary action to enhance soil biodiversity in cities would need to take-into-account both soil properties and the landscape around.

TI Drivers of fungal diversity and community biogeography differ between
   green roofs and adjacent ground-level green space
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Green roof soils are usually engineered for purposes other than urban biodiversity, which may impact their fungal communities, and in turn impact the health of plants in the urban ecosystem. We examined the drivers of fungal diversity and community composition in soil of green roofs and adjacent ground-level green spaces in three Midwestern USA cities-Chicago, Cleveland, and Minneapolis. Overall, fungal communities on green roofs were more diverse than ground-level green spaces and were correlated with plant cover (positively) and roof age (negatively) rather than abiotic soil properties. Fungal community composition was distinct between roof and ground environments, among cities, and between sampling sites, but green roofs and their immediately surrounding ground-level green space showed some similarity. This suggests dispersal limitation may result in geographic structuring at large spatial scales, but dispersal between roofs and their neighbouring sites may be occurring. Different fungal taxonomic and functional groups were better explained when roofs were classified either by depth (extensive or intensive) or functional intent of the roof design (i.e. stormwater/energy, biodiversity, or aesthetics/recreation). Our results demonstrate that green roofs are an important reservoir of fungal diversity in the urban landscape, which should be considered in future green roof design.

TI Urban green roofs can support a diversity of parasitoid wasps
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Green roofs are often installed atop buildings to provide ecological services such as mitigating storm water runoff and cooling air within urban heat islands. We found that green roofs in Portland, Oregon, also can support biodiversity, including a diverse assemblage of parasitoid wasps, with 20 morphospecies from 10 families present on the four roofs we surveyed. The roofs with greater plant diversity and structural complexity harbored comparatively more parasitoid morphospecies than the structurally simpler Sedum-dominated roofs. The oldest green roof supported much greater diversity than the younger roofs, including a comparably planted roof three times its size. Parasitoid wasps from the Hymenopteran families we found are high-trophic-level organisms known to feed on a variety of arthropods, including many insects commonly considered to be pests in urban areas. We suggest that green roofs have the potential to provide an often-overlooked ecological service by supporting parasitoid wasps that can act as natural biological control agents.

TI The Bird Dawn Chorus Strength of an Urban Soundscape and Its Potential
   to Assess Urban Green Spaces
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green areas in urban environments, such as urban parks and urban gardens, are known to provide benefits called "ecosystem services" to the urban community. Green recreational spaces offer opportunities for physical activity, leading to improved physical and mental health of residents. For this reason, the presence and the quality of such areas has to be considered and promoted in sustainable urban planning, especially in the context of contributing to the achievement sustainable cities. As the biodiversity of an area is an indication of its quality, soundecological indicators have been used to assess the biodiversity in natural areas. Due to the presence of anthropogenic sounds in urban areas, the use of these indicators to determine the quality of urban areas can be questioned. However, the vocal activity of collectively singing birds during the dawn chorus contributes to the urban soundscape, and results in a prominent biophonic component of this soundscape, as can be clearly seen in its yearly pattern. The use of soundecological indicators through the estimation of the Bird Dawn Chorus Strength has the potential to provide a means of assessing the quality of urban green spaces. To demonstrate this potential, a pilot study is presented here on the annual temporal scale of the soundscape of a typical urban green space.

TI Small Urban Green Roof Plots Near Larger Green Spaces May Not Provide
   Additional Habitat for Birds
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to urbanization. However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.

TI Assessing Green Roof Contributions to Tree Canopy Ecosystem Services and
   Connectivity in a Highly Urbanized Area
SO LAND
AB Ecosystem services refer to the benefits provided to humans by the natural environment and healthy ecosystems. Green roofs can be used to enhance ecosystem services, which are reduced by urbanization. Moreover, green roofs can improve biodiversity by connecting green spaces. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the multi-dimensional contributions of green roofs to urban ecosystems. To this end, we used i-Tree Canopy to identify changes in land cover and tree canopy ecosystem services from 2003 to 2021 in Suwon City, Republic of Korea. Next, we simulated improved ecosystem service effects of tree canopies by green roofs. Graph theory was also used to analyze connectivity improvement at local and landscape scales. Tree area was found to decrease from 2003 to 2012, alongside the corresponding ecosystem services, which then showed a tendency to increase from 2012 to 2021. The tree area was expected to increase further in the green roof scenario than in 2003. Green roofs were found to improve tree canopy connectivity at the landscape scale more than the local scale, by acting as stepping stones in connecting fragmented forests and trees. Areas with improved connectivity at both scales should be prioritized for green roof development. These results will aid in the strategic planning of urban green infrastructure and provide support for decision-making processes to improve ecosystem services and connectivity using green roofs.

AB Cities play a considerable role in landscape protection and global biodiversity conservation. They comprise several habitat types, from remnant patches of native vegetation, urban wastelands, gardens, yards, etc., to highly engineered green infrastructures, such as green walls/roofs and bioswales. Landscape planners are increasingly aware about the need to re-connect, through the urban-rural gradient, the endangered urban biodiversity with the surrounding natural areas. This need is even more urgent in case of urban settlements experiencing a remarkable growth in their population due to a heavy increase of tourism flows. This is the case of the City of Matera (Southern Italy), an UNESCO site currently selected as the European Cultural Capital 2019, which is facing an impressive growth in tourism population and relevant services. Hosting a Site of Community Importance, as well as a Special Protection Area, this city urgently needs suitable actions aimed to plan and manage its Urban Green Spaces (UGS), i.e., urban green areas finalized to provide ecological, environmental, recreational and economic benefits, restoring its environmental resilience. In this paper, the actual UGS surfaces in Matera have been quantified with multi-source data and GIS tools, and the pattern assessed through specific landscape metrics, implementing a Decision Support System (DSS).

TI Floral resources encourage colonisation and use of green roofs by
   invertebrates
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Green roof retrofits offer a promising avenue to increase greenspace and thus biodiversity in the city. The successful colonisation and establishment of plants and animals on green roofs is limited by the location and context of the green roof. Here we use a before, after, control, impact (BACI) design to monitor the colonisation of a new retrofit roof in Melbourne CBD. We find that colonisation for some taxa occurs rapidly, with honeybees (Apis mellifera) arriving four days after flowers had been planted. Other insect taxa, such as native bees, did not colonise the impact roof but were present on the green roof reference site, which was lower in height and planted with native plants. Invertebrate abundance increased for all sites after the retrofit was built, however this sampling period was in late spring when more insects are expected to be active. Bird richness and abundance didn't change in response to roof greening, but invertebrate richness was significantly higher on reference sites and increased after the green roof retrofit was built for the impact site. There was an apparent 'spill over' effect onto the nearby green roof control, which also increased in invertebrate diversity. Overall, invertebrate composition across roof types was driven by floral density. Floral density and richness increased on the impact roof as vegetation matured, subsequently correlating with higher abundance and richness of invertebrates. We use these findings to discuss colonisation of green roofs and argue for strategic placement of new green roof retrofits to maximise their biodiversity potential.

TI Urban Rooftop Agriculture: Challenges to Science and Practice
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Urban green infrastructure includes both natural inputs and artificial supplements, including irrigation, synthetic substrates, and drainage layers. Green infrastructure aims to make cities more resilient and less dependent on outside resource inputs through more efficient use. Over the past 2 decades, these constructed ecosystems have expanded to include green roofs, elevated urban parks, and rooftop vegetable farms. This paper outlines opportunities and challenges for advancing the science of these constructed ecosystems with particular emphasis on rooftop agriculture. Although in concept rooftop agriculture could contribute to urban food security, water management, and biodiversity, research comparing design and management strategies across climate zones and regional economies is necessary to fully integrate ecological understanding into urban planning policy.

TI Insect biodiversity of urban green spaces in Penang Island, Malaysia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB Declining biodiversity is receiving much attention around the world and green spaces in urban areas can help enhance biodiversity by creating habitat for living organisms especially from the class Insecta. Insects maintain biodiversity on earth and play a key role in the regulation as well as dynamics of many ecosystem services. Insect conservation especially in urban areas can be done by protecting the beneficial habitat from human activity and creating an environment with modifications to facilitate the target insect's conservation such as creating green roof spaces. In this study, the richness of insect species was assessed from two different vegetation arrangements, vertical and horizontal, from different sampling sites and noting their light intensity, solar radiation and relative humidity. There was no significant correlation between insect species richness and all the three abiotic factors (p > 0.05). However, different plant types; flowering and non-flowering, were found to affect the richness of insect species, with relatively more insect species present at study sites with flowering plants compared to study sites with non-flowering plants (p < 0.05). This information can help to develop a sustainable and comprehensive environment in urban areas.

TI The effect of drainage height on plant-species composition on a
   semi-arid green roof system
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB Green roofs are expected to contribute to higher biodiversity in urban surroundings. Typically, green roofs have been designed with low plant diversity. However, plant diversity can be enhanced by controlling resource availability and creating distinct niches. Here we hypothesize that by using different drainage heights during the short plant-growing season in a semi-arid green roof system we can create distinct niches and plant communities. Our experiment took place at the University of Haifa, north Israel. We tested three different heights of drainage outlet: 10 cm under the surface of the substrate (Low), 1 cm under the surface of the substrate (Medium) and 3 cm above the surface of the substrate (High) on plant species-composition in green-roof gardens. Grasses cover was higher in High and Medium drainages while forbs cover was higher in Low drainage. Species richness was the highest in Low drainage while diversity indices showed the opposite trend. We conclude that by changing the height of the drainage we can create different niches and change species composition in a short time period of one growing season. This way we can create more diverse green roof communities and enhance biodiversity in urban areas, particularly in semi-arid regions.

TI Can we integrate ecological approaches to improve plant selection for
   green infrastructure?
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Modern cities are dominated by impervious surfaces that absorb, store and release heat in summer, create large volumes of runoff and provide limited biodiversity habitat and poor air quality can also be a health issue. Future climate change, including more frequent and extreme weather events will likely exacerbate these issues. Green infrastructure such as parks, gardens, street trees and engineered technologies such as green roofs and walls, facades and raingardens can help mitigate these problems. This relies on selecting plants that can persist in urban environments and improve stormwater retention, cooling, biodiversity and air pollution. However, plant se-lection for green infrastructure is challenging where there is limited information on species tolerance to heat and water variability or how these species can deliver multiple benefits. Therefore, we draw on research to illustrate how plant performance for green infrastructure can be inferred from plant attributes (i.e., traits) or from analysis of their natural distribution. We present a new framework for plant selection for green infrastructure and use a case study to demonstrate how this approach has been used to select trees and shrubs for Australian cities. We have shown through the case study and examples, how plant traits and species' natural distribution can be used to overcome the lack of information on tolerance to both individual and multiple stressors; and how species contribute to the provision of benefits such as stormwater retention, cooling, biodiversity and air pollution mitigation. We also discuss how planting design and species diversity can contribute to achieving multiple benefits to make the most of contested space in dense cities, and to also reduce the risk of failure in urban greening.

TI The effect of urban green roof design on beetle biodiversity
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB The biodiversity conservation value of urban green spaces depends in part on design and management. The importance of habitat quality and complexity to species diversity has led to the suggestion that habitat design elements-varied substrate, greater plant diversity, logs or stones-would support invertebrate diversity on green roofs. To evaluate this possibility, we conducted pit-fall trap sampling on three green roofs of simple design (intended primarily for stormwater management), three habitat roofs, and five ground-level green spaces, in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Beetles (Coleoptera) were sampled as representatives of total invertebrate diversity. Diversity was compared using sample coverage and Hill numbers to account for differences in sample intensity and fundamental differences in species diversity. Both habitat roofs and ground sites consisted of just over 20% native species, while stormwater roofs had about 5% native species, all of which were considered pests. We collected a greater abundance of beetles on the ground compared to roof sites like others have shown. However, when sample completeness is taken into account, habitat roofs had greater Shannon diversity compared to both ground and stormwater roof sites. Habitat roofs had the fewest dominant species representing 5% or more of total abundance, but also the lowest percent of species represented by singletons (27%). These results indicate that green roofs can support different beetle communities compared to those present at ground-level urban green spaces; our results also support previous findings that biodiverse design can reliably increase green roof diversity compared to more simply designed roofs.

TI Integrating Green Infrastructure into Urban Planning: Developing
   Melbourne's Green Factor Tool
SO URBAN PLANNING
AB As cities increase in size and density, the ecosystem services supplied by urban greenery and green infrastructure are increasingly vital for sustainable, liveable urban areas. However, retaining and maximising urban greenery in densifying cities is challenging. Governments have critical roles in addressing these challenges through policy development and implementation. While there has been significant attention on the quality and quantity of green space on public land, there is an increasing focus on policy mechanisms for integrating green infrastructure into the private realm, including green roofs, walls, facades, balconies and gardens. As part of City of Melbourne's efforts to increase greening across the municipality, its 2017 Green Our City Strategic Action Plan includes specific focus on the private realm, and development of regulatory processes for green infrastructure. This article reports on a participatory research project to develop a Green Factor Tool for application to building development proposals in Melbourne. We focus on the transdisciplinary collaborations that brought together contributions from researchers, practitioners, policymakers and designers. We discuss how local research on green space contributions to provision of ecosystem services shaped the design of the tool and provided the tool's rigorous evidence-base. Finally, we consider the roles of urban planning in retaining and maximising urban green spaces in densifying urban areas.

TI Pollinator emerging from extensive green roofs: wild bees (Hymenoptera,
   Antophila) and hoverflies (Diptera, Syrphidae) in Geneva (Switzerland)
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB By the end of 2020, 75% of the Swiss population will live in cities. The urban densification will result in habitat and biodiversity loss. One solution to mitigate this loss in urban environments is the implementation of green roofs that are now recognised as a tool for the maintenance of epigeal and aerial arthropods. Green roofs can provide various services such as pollination and food supply for insects and various arthropods (e.g. arachnids) and animals (e.g. birds). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of pollinating insects emerging from urban green roofs. Wild bees (Hymenoptera) and hoverflies (Diptera) were sampled using emergence traps on six extensive green roofs in the urban area of Geneva (Switzerland), from March to August 2017. Five species of wild bees and two species of hoverflies were identified: Lasioglossum morio (Halictidae) and Sphaerophoria scripta (Syrphidae) are the only two species considered as emerging from green roofs in our study. Ecological traits of these two species indicated generalists, well adapted to xero-thermophilic conditions.

TI Towards the design of biodiverse green roofs in Argentina: Assessing key
   elements for different functional groups of arthropods
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Green roofs offer numerous environmental benefits, and thus their implementation is considered an initiative to create sustainable cities. However, the characteristics of green roofs that could enhance arthropod biodiversity and ecological functioning are poorly known, especially for South American countries. Here, we analyzed the influence of several characteristics of green roofs (plant species richness, vegetation cover of the roof, age, substrate depth, area, and isolation in terms of height and green cover in the landscape scale) on the abundance, richness (total and by functional feeding groups), and community composition of arthropods. To do that, we selected 30 green roofs located in different urbanization contexts, from small towns in semi-rural areas to Cordoba, the second-largest city of Argentina. Our results indicated a high diversity of arthropods, registering a total of 12,942 individuals corresponding to 505 species from 14 orders, being herbivores and parasitoids the dominant groups. The area of the green roofs was positively linked to total species richness, species richness of most functional feeding groups, and total abundance of arthropods. The community composition of arthropods on green roofs was also affected by their area, and by the green cover in the landscape. Moreover, green roofs with higher plant richness, mainly spontaneous, and less isolated (both vertically and horizontally) favored entomophagous arthropods. Other variables, such as age and vegetation cover of the green roofs, were also important for herbivores, predators, parasitoids and detritivores. Our study clearly demonstrates that green roof size is not all that matters for supporting arthropod biodiversity because promoting high plant diversity, allowing spontaneous ecosystem dynamics, and diminishing roof isolation foster entomophagous arthropod diversity. Our study is the first that considers multiple factors of roofs in South America and provides key knowledge for stakeholders interested in the development and management of this green infrastructure in semi-rural and urban landscapes.

TI Green Roof Enhancement on Buildings of the University of Applied
   Sciences in Neubrandenburg (Germany) in Times of Climate Change
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB The reduction in evaporative surfaces in cities is one driver for longer and hotter summers. Greening building surfaces can help to mitigate the loss of vegetated cover. Typical extensive green roof structures, such as sedum-based solutions, survive in dry periods, but how can green roofs be made to be more effective for the longer hot and dry periods to come? The research findings are based on continuous vegetation analytics of typical extensive green roofs over the past 20 years. -Survival of longer dry periods by fully adapted plants species with a focus on the fittest and best adapted species. -Additional technical and treatment solutions to support greater water storage in the media in dry periods and to support greater plant biomass/high biodiversity on the roofs by optimizing growing media with fertilizer to achieve higher evapotranspiration (short: ET) values. The main findings of this research: -The climate benefits of green roofs are associated with the quantity of phytomass. Selecting the right growing media is critical. -Typical extensive green roof substrates have poor nutrition levels. Fertilizer can significantly boost the ecological effects on CO2 fixation. -If the goal of the green roof is a highly biodiverse green roof, micro-structures are the right solution.

TI Biodiversity of collembola on green roofs: A case study of three cities
   in Belgium
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Green roofs are often promoted as a mean to counter the negative environmental effects of urbanization on nature and to increase the amount of green space in cities. Green roofs often enhance aboveground biodiversity, especially herbivores and pollinators. However, if and in what way they support belowground biodiversity, and more specifically soil fauna, is rarely studied. Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics. However, we suggest that future studies are needed to investigate whether our findings are applicable to other groups of soil-living arthropods.

TI The bee fauna (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) of allotments in
   downtown Lisbon
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY
AB In the last ten years, a growing number of studies have focused on urban green areas as potential refuges for biodiversity, where private gardens, urban parks and green roofs have relatively high diversities of wild bees. However, the western Mediterranean is still poorly studied and is a biodiversity hotspot that is already suffering the consequences of climate change. It is essential to rectify this and understand how urban settings can support biodiversity. In this context, this study provides an assessment of the taxonomic and functional composition of bee assemblages in three allotments in downtown Lisbon, Portugal. Using only an entomological net, we collected 202 specimens from April to July 2018, belonging to fi ve families, 20 genera and 58 species, of which six are rare species in Portugal and nine first records for the Lisbon district. Megachilidae was the most diverse family, comprising 15 species, while Apidae was the most abundant family. Most of the species identifi ed were solitary and had a generalist pollen diet, with a low incidence of social and parasitic species.

TI Combinations of plant species with complementary traits have the
   potential to maximize ecosystem services on green roofs
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Ecosystem services are critical in urban areas, where the majority of humanity now lives. In many cities, extensive green roofs are planted with succulent nonnative Sedum species that provide rapid vegetative cover, retain stormwater, insulate buildings, and provide cooling through evapotranspiration. If diverse native plant species were used on green roofs in addition to Sedum, green roofs could also support greater biodiversity. Ecosystem services provided by Sedum are documented within temperate climates but the contributions of native forbs are relatively unknown, largely due to difficulties in plant establishment. Survival, drought-tolerance, and stormwater capture of native plants may be enhanced by inoculating the soil with indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. In this experiment, we tested the hypotheses that green roofs planted with diverse native species would provide the ecosystem services of thermal building insulation, evapotranspiration, and stormwater capture and be aided by inoculation with indigenous AM fungi. We used green roof trays in a multi-factorial design to test for the effects of vegetation community and AMF inoculation on provisioning of ecosystem services in two locations. Despite slower establishment, native plant communities showed greater stormwater capture and evapotranspiration rates compared to Sedum communities. However, Sedum provided greater thermal insulation during the hot months of summer. Inoculation with AM fungi did not improve plant establishment or provisioning of ecosystem services. Overall, our results suggest that planting a variety of native prairie grasses and forbs may maximize ecosystem services provided by urban green roofs.

AB The integration of Green Roofs (GRs) within urban areas is widely recognised as being crucial for improving urban sustainability. Improvement is largely achieved through the creation of habitats to support urban biodiversity and via the restoration of ecosystem services, which are vital inmediating the impacts of climate change within highly developed areas. Unlike many European countries, Scotland does not currently have a mandatory policy on the inclusion of GRs in urban areas. Consequently, there is a distinct lack of available data on existing GRs in Scotland, which presents issues regarding the monitoring of climate adaptation strategies. The principal aim of this study was to conduct an inventory of GRs within the city of Edinburgh, to provide baseline data, to inform policy. Investigative methods used QGIS with satellite imagery to identify and record GR locations and properties, with findings subject to ground-truthing for verification. To date, survey findings have revealed a total of 83 existing GRs within Edinburgh, which is almost three times as many as reported by a Central Scotland Green Network study previously. The GRs appear to be largely concentrated in the city center where they provide a considerable contribution towards local biodiversity and alleviation of flood risks, as well as several other benefits. The existing GRs are predominantly located on commercial buildings indicating a growing buy-in from local businesses. The results of this study will be of use in future policy making in Scotland, as well as for further research on the resilience and ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure.

TI Biodiversity's contributions to sustainable development
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB International concern to develop sustainably challenges us to act upon the inherent links between our economy, society and environment, and is leading to increasing acknowledgement of biodiversity's importance. This Review discusses the breadth of ways in which biodiversity can support sustainable development. It uses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a basis for exploring scientific evidence of the benefits delivered by biodiversity. It focuses on papers that provide examples of how biodiversity components (that is, ecosystems, species and genes) directly deliver benefits that may contribute to the achievement of individual SDGs. It also considers how biodiversity's direct contributions to fulfilling some SDGs may indirectly support the achievement of other SDGs to which biodiversity does not contribute directly. How the attributes (for example, diversity, abundance or composition) of biodiversity components influence the benefits delivered is also presented, where described by the papers reviewed. While acknowledging potential negative impacts and trade-offs between different benefits, the study concludes that biodiversity may contribute to fulfilment of all SDGs.

TI Greening the city: Thriving for biodiversity and sustainability
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Urban population and urbanisation are increasing rapidly, mainly in developing countries, usually at the expense of green and blue areas. This trend will decrease the ecosystems' capacity to supply ecosystem services (ES) and threaten human wellbeing. Therefore, it is key to establish greening policies in urbanising areas, which are essential to improve the liveability of cities. Restoring and developing green and blue infrastructures using nature-based solutions is vital to improving urban biodiversity and urban ecosystems. Healthy urban ecosystems have a high capacity to supply regulating (e.g., air, noise, climate and water regulation), provisioning (e.g., food, medicinal plants, biomass) and cultural (e.g., recreation, landscape aesthetics, social cohesion) ES. This multifunctionality can provide diverse environmental, social and economic benefits to urban residents, hence contributing to the sustainability of urban areas. However, urban green and blue areas are also associated with ecosystem disservices (e.g., plant allergies or poisoning, emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, unpleasant smells), tradeoffs (e.g., increased water consumption, wildfire risk, associated management costs) and implementation barriers (e.g., political motivation, lack of knowledge, time and workload). Overall, the SI published 8 articles from different parts of the world, such as China, the USA, Italy or Spain, focused on important aspects of greening the city (e.g., green roofs, green walls, green infrastructures, sustainable mobility).

TI Shading enhances plant species richness and diversity on an extensive
   green roof
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Green roofs can promote biodiversity in urban areas. The extent to which green roofs stimulate plant diversity can depend on roof characteristics such as roof age, substrate depth and shading. We exploratively studied the vegetation on a Dutch green roof in 50 permanent plots (1 m(2)) over eight years (2012-2019) following roof construction. Plots were situated either on low substrate depth (6 cm light-weight extensive substrate) or high substrate depth (6 cm light-weight extensive substrate topped with 14 cm native soil) and differed in the amount of shading received from a higher building floor. Increased substrate depth and shading additively increased plant species richness and plant diversity, with high shaded plots supporting on average 6.4 more plant species than low unshaded plots. Shading likely acts via reducing drought stress, whereas increasing substrate depth with native soil may also enhance plant diversity via addition of nutrients and native seeds. The vegetation composition on the roof was dynamic and changed over the years. Sedum acre was initially dominant but disappeared within the first years, whereas Sedum kamtschaticum increased and became dominant in the last years. Trifolium arvense was the most abundant forb species and was especially dominant three years after roof construction. We conclude that increased substrate depth and shading can promote plant species richness and diversity and recommend that both aspects are considered when green roofs are designed. Shading can be achieved by a stepped building architecture and by placing structures on the roof itself, such as solar panels on standards.

TI Improving Urban Habitat Connectivity for Native Birds: Using Least-Cost
   Path Analyses to Design Urban Green Infrastructure Networks
SO LAND
AB Habitat loss and fragmentation are primary threats to biodiversity in urban areas. Least-cost path analyses are commonly used in ecology to identify and protect wildlife corridors and stepping-stone habitats that minimise the difficulty and risk for species dispersing across human-modified landscapes. However, they are rarely considered or used in the design of urban green infrastructure networks, particularly those that include building-integrated vegetation, such as green walls and green roofs. This study uses Linkage Mapper, an ArcGIS toolbox, to identify the least-cost paths for four native keystone birds (kereru, tui, korimako, and hihi) in Wellington, New Zealand, to design a network of green roof corridors that ease native bird dispersal. The results identified 27 least-cost paths across the central city that connect existing native forest habitats. Creating 0.7 km(2) of green roof corridors along these least-cost paths reduced cost-weighted distances by 8.5-9.3% for the kereru, tui, and korimako, but there was only a 4.3% reduction for the hihi (a small forest bird). In urban areas with little ground-level space for green infrastructure, this study demonstrates how least-cost path analyses can inform the design of building-integrated vegetation networks and quantify their impacts on corridor quality for target species in cities.

TI Socio-Ecological Dimensions of Spontaneous Plants on Green Roofs
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB Green roofs have the potential to provide socio-ecological services in urban settings that lack vegetation and open space. However, implementation of green roofs is limited by high construction and maintenance costs. Consequently, green roof projects often disproportionately benefit wealthy communities and can further marginalise disadvantaged communities by increasing property values and housing costs. Vegetation cover on green roofs is crucial to their provisioning of socio-ecological services. Evidence suggests that green roof plantings change over time, especially with limited maintenance, and are replaced with spontaneous "weedy" species. This is often perceived as a failure of the original green roof design intent and spontaneous species are usually removed. However, where good coverage is achieved, spontaneous vegetation could provide beneficial services such as stormwater mitigation, habitat provision, and climate regulation. While social norms about "weediness" may limit the desirability of some spontaneous species, research suggests that their acceptability on green roofs increases with coverage. As spontaneous species can establish on green roofs without irrigation and fertiliser, reduced input costs could help facilitate adoption particularly in markets without an established green roof industry. Construction costs may also be reduced in hot and dry climates where deeper substrates are necessary to ensure plant survival, as many spontaneous species are able to colonise shallow substrates and can regenerate from seed. If implemented based on socio-ecological need, green roofs with spontaneous vegetation coverage may apply less pressure to property values and housing costs than conventionally planted green roofs, increasing the resilience of urban communities while limiting gentrification.

TI Challenges and Opportunities for Soil Biodiversity in the Anthropocene
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB Biodiversity on Earth is strongly affected by human alterations to the environment. The majority of studies have considered aboveground biodiversity, yet little is known about whether biodiversity changes below-ground follow the same patterns as those observed aboveground. It is now established that communities of soil biota have been substantially altered by direct human activities such as soil sealing, agricultural land-use intensification, and biological invasions resulting from the introduction of non-native species. In addition, altered abiotic conditions resulting from climate change have also impacted soil biodiversity. These changes in soil biodiversity can alter ecosystem functions performed by the soil biota, and therefore, human-induced global changes have a feedback effect on ecosystem services via altered soil biodiversity. Here, we highlight the major phenomena that threaten soil biodiversity, and we propose options to reverse the decline in soil biodiversity. We argue that it is essential to protect soil biodiversity as a rich reservoir that provides insurance against the changes wrought by the Anthropocene. Overall, we need to better understand the determinants of soil biodiversity and how they function, plan to avoid further losses, and restore soil biodiversity where possible. Safeguarding this rich biotic reservoir is essential for soil sustainability and, ultimately, the sustainability of human society.

TI GI Guidelines for the Metropolitan City of Cagliari (Italy): A Method
   for Implementing Green Areas
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The decline of natural capital resulting from urbanization has triggered phenomena such as landscape fragmentation and loss of biodiversity. European institutions have published documents and strategies with the purpose of counteracting such phenomena. In this regard, in 2020 the European Commission released the European Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which defines biodiversity conservation objectives and promotes the implementation of green infrastructures (GIs) designed to supply ecosystem services, which can increase people's well-being. The scientific literature has scarcely dealt with methods for drafting guidance documents (guidelines) to support public administrations in the implementation of GIs. In this study, we aim at designing and applying a method for drafting GI guidelines. We apply the method to the Metropolitan City of Cagliari, the main urbanized area-which partially includes the former Province of Cagliari-of Sardinia (Italy). According to the findings, a proposal of GI guidelines should be rooted in context analysis and consistency checks and should be tailored to specific geographical and institutional contexts. The preliminary guidelines described in this study are designed to provide public administrations with GI guidelines based on scientific, technical, and cultural considerations, and are aimed at supporting an effective implementation of GIs and a GI network.

TI Long-Term Performance of Blue-Green Roof Systems-Results of a
   Building-Scale Monitoring Study in Hamburg, Germany
SO WATER
AB For the first time, a long-term monitoring study with different full-scale blue-green roof (BGR) types was conducted. Within a pilot project from Hamburg's Rainwater InfraStructure Adaptation (RISA) framework, four different BGR types were built in 2015 for long-term evaluation and comparison with each other. The test site was created to find out to what extent BGRs are able to improve hydrological performance and if increased water supply affects vegetation development and species diversity. Therefore, the roofs were equipped with hydrologic monitoring systems, their retention performance was evaluated, and vegetation analysis was conducted. During 2017-2023, between 64 and 74% of the precipitation was retained on the roofs, and in the summer months there was hardly any outflow from the roofs. For single (heavy) rain events, high retention capacities, low outflow intensities, and high detention times were demonstrated. On the BGRs where rainwater is permanently stored on the roof, the vegetation species' composition changed in the long term, resulting in an increase in biodiversity. The studied BGRs are effective in reducing flood risk from heavy rain events and can increase evaporative cooling and biodiversity. Therefore, such BGRs are a blue-green infrastructure with far-reaching positive effects.

TI Governing urban greening at a metropolitan scale: an analysis of the
   <i>Living Melbourne</i> strategy
SO AUSTRALIAN PLANNER
AB As Australian cities face challenges of increased size, density and a range of environmental issues, compounded by climate change impacts, integration of greening is receiving increased attention. Greening, in the form of parks, gardens, waterways, water-sensitive designs and green roofs, contributes to liveability, sustainability and resilience, and habitat for non-human species. Local governments are responsible for the day-to-day management of much of Australia's urban public spaces and are developing strategies for these areas. However, local-scale planning risks piecemeal, uncoordinated and ineffective approaches, particularly for biophysical systems that have little relationship with municipal boundaries. How can a metropolitan-scale approach be applied to green space planning and governance? This paper presents a case study of Living Melbourne metropolitan urban forest strategy, developed by Nature Conservancy and Resilient Melbourne. Resilient Melbourne brings together Melbourne's 32 local governments to plan and advocate at the metropolitan scale. While the Living Melbourne strategy provides a metropolitan-scale approach, questions of governance, including how the strategy will be implemented and how local context is understood, are highlighted. Further, in developing a metropolitan-scale approach, how are the voices of local communities included? The paper analyses who is governing Melbourne's urban greening, and the benefits and risks of a metropolitan-scale approach.

TI Plant diversity on green roofs in the wild: Testing practitioner and
   ecological predictions in three midwestern (USA) cities
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Green roofs are urban design elements providing ecosystem services in cities, yet little is understood about how to plan for their biodiversity and conservation outcomes. Using both green roof practitioner and ecological knowledge as a guide, this study examined how well we can predict the relationships between plant species richness and the characteristics of green roofs. Forty-two roofs in three U.S. cities (Chicago, Cleveland, and Minneapolis) were surveyed for plant species richness, soil characteristics, plant cover, maintenance, age, and area. Results indicate practitioner and ecological assumptions were approximately equally accurate in predicting relationships, but neither set of assumptions was particularly reliable. Diversity differed between cities, and plant communities on intensive roofs were more diverse than on extensive roofs. Plant diversity on intensive roofs was also more responsive to soil texture, area, and fertilizer use, when compared to extensive roofs. Intensive roofs may be more responsive to variables due to substrate depth increasing potential plant diversity, coupled with a wider variability in design intentions than is typical for extensive roofs. While the two knowledge bases influencing green roof understanding are a good starting point to explain green roof dynamics, new classifications (beyond extensive and intensive roofs) could help bridge the gap between practitioner and ecological knowledge and aid in predicting patterns by emphasizing green roof design intent rather than substrate depth. Our study indicates that using scientific research to further examine green roof landscapes is necessary for improving the accuracy and generalizability of predictions derived from both applied practitioner knowledge and ecological theory.

TI Substrate composition impacts long-term vegetation development on
   blue-green roofs: Insights from an experimental roof and greenhouse
   study
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Green roofs provide ecosystem services and can promote biodiversity in urban areas. Blue-green roofs have an additional water storage compartment under the substrate to reduce roof water runoff, thereby also reducing drought stress which is beneficial for green roof vegetation. In order to study which blue-green roof design supports the highest plant diversity, we assessed the effect of different substrates and seed mixtures on vegetation development in a short-term greenhouse experiment and long-term blue-green roof experiment. A ten-week full -factorial greenhouse experiment was performed for six substrate composition and four seed mixture treatments. On an experimental blue-green roof, we annually surveyed plants from 2013 to 2021 in nine different treatments (five replicates each), that varied in substrate composition, substrate depth and seed mixture that was initially applied. Two treatments resembled conventional non-green roofs (100% gravel) and conventional extensive Sedum green roofs. The results of the greenhouse experiment showed that seed mixture is more important than substrate composition in shaping the initial species richness and species composition. However, on the experi-mental roof the substrate composition was an important determinant of species richness and species composition long-term. Plant species richness on the experimental roof was lowest in the gravel treatment (resembling conventional non-green roofs), and highest in treatments where locally collected soil was used, likely due to additional species that appeared from the seed bank present in the transplanted soil. Soil was never completely covered with vegetation on unfertilized substrates that contained 20% or less dense and organic materials. Plant species richness on conventional Sedum roof substrate was higher on the experimental blue-green roof compared to an adjacent non-blue roof, highlighting that blue-green roofs can promote biodiversity more than conventional green roofs. For future construction of blue-green roofs in our region, we recommend the addition of 30% locally collected soil to a 6 cm deep lightweight substrate to maximize long-term plant cover and plant species richness.

TI Fine-scale substrate heterogeneity does not affect arthropod communities
   on green roofs
SO PEERJ
AB Green roofs, which are roofs with growing substrate and vegetation, can provide habitat for arthropods in cities. Maintaining a diversity of arthropods in an urban environment can enhance the functions they fill, such as pest control and soil development. Theory suggests that the creation of a heterogeneous environment on green roofs would enhance arthropod diversity. Several studies have examined how arthropod diversity can be enhanced on green roofs, and particularly whether substrate properties affect the arthropod community, but a gap remains in identifying the effect of substrate heterogeneity within a green roof on the arthropod community. In this paper, it is hypothesized that creating heterogeneity in the substrate would directly affect the diversity and abundance of some arthropod taxa, and indirectly increase arthropod diversity through increased plant diversity. These hypotheses were tested using green roof plots in four treatments of substrate heterogeneity: (1) homogeneous dispersion; (2) mineral heterogeneity-with increased tuff concentration in subplots; (3) organic heterogeneity-with decreased compost concentrations in subplots; (4) both mineral and organic heterogeneity. Each of the four treatments was replicated twice on each of three roofs (six replicates per treatment) in a Mediterranean region. There was no effect of substrate heterogeneity on arthropod diversity, abundance, or community composition, but there were differences in arthropod communities among roofs. This suggests that the location of a green roof, which can differ in local climatic conditions, can have a strong effect on the composition of the arthropod community. Thus, arthropod diversity may be promoted by building green roofs in a variety of locations throughout a city, even if the roof construction is similar on all roofs.

TI Land snail dispersal, abundance and diversity on green roofs
SO PLOS ONE
AB We present the first major systematic study of land snail diversity on green roofs. We surveyed 27 green roofs and the adjacent ground habitat in six major cities in the southeastern United States. We found a total of 18 species of land snails, with three considered to be non-native or invasive species. The majority of land snails encountered in surveys are widespread, generalist species, typically adapted to open habitats. Twelve of the land snails encountered are "greenhouse" species that are very commonly transported via the horticultural trade. Therefore, we infer that at least some land snail species are introduced to green roofs via initial green roof installation and associated landscaping. The major determinants of snail species richness and abundance are the size of each roof and the quality of green roof maintenance regime.

TI Arthropod diversity and ecological processes on green roofs in a
   semi-rural area of Argentina: Similarity to neighbor ground habitats and
   landscape effects
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB Green roofs could mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by providing habitats for arthropods. However, more studies are necessary to understand if these new ecosystems can harbor similar numbers of species and levels of ecological processes than habitats at the ground-level. In 15 houses of 1-2 floors with extensive green roofs from a semi-rural area in Cordoba (central Argentina), we analyzed the species richness and abundance of arthropods on green roofs and their neighboring ground-level habitats and evaluated the influence of landscape composition (proportion of buildings, grasslands, and streets). We focus on feeding groups (herbivores, predators, omnivores, detritivores, parasitoids, and pollinators) and two ecological processes (herbivory and predation). Moreover, we tested two factors that may drive the communities on ground-level habitats and green roofs: habitat area and plant species richness. Species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and by feeding groups), and predation rates were significantly higher in ground-level habitats than on green roofs. Nevertheless, arthropod diversity on living roofs was striking, with almost 400 species from different feeding groups. Street cover in the landscape negatively affected total richness and several feeding groups. On ground-level habitats, herbivory increased with street cover and predation with grassland cover. The main factor driving arthropods in both green roofs and ground-level habitats was habitat area, whereas plant richness had a positive effect only in predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Our results reinforce the role of green roofs as habitat for arthropod species in semi-rural areas of Latin-American countries, where the evidence was so far lacking.

TI Low productivity substrate leads to functional diversification of green
   roof plant assemblage
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Green roofs are roof free spaces where living organisms can find an appropriate habitat to colonise. The establishment of plant species with different functionality can enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. However, drought and nutrient availability can affect the plant development. The extensive green roof was set up in Pisa (Italy) in 2014, 12 modules of 10 cm depth were filled with three substrates composed of compost from municipal mixed waste, pelletised paper sludge, and commercial tephra product (Vulcaflor), as follows: Vulcaflor + compost, Vulcaflor + pellet + compost, and Vulcaflor + pellet, characterised by decreasing level of nitrogen content. The species planted in 2014 were chosen from the herbaceous spontaneous vegetation of urban and rural swards not often mowed, plus two sedum species. After the establishment phase, the green roof community was progressively dominated by Sedum species and other species were seeded in 2016. In 2018-19 the plant functional types and the community structure were monitored. Besides seasonal fluctuations, nitrogen shaped the composition of the community, and Sedum species showed high cover values in nitrogen-richer substrates. Annual forbs colonised the plots with a lower nitrogen content. In summer, the number of species drastically fell, and Sedum album was dominant in the three substrates. Seedling recruitment regenerated the community in the cooler season, increasing the diversity in the poor substrate. The scarcity of nitrogen led to the development of stress-tolerator annuals increasing the biodiversity in the rainy-cool season. Annual species constitute a transient seed bank which enables the system to regenerate when rain follows periods of heat and drought.

TI The plant and faunal species composition and diversity on rooftop farms:
   Seasonal variation and the effects of site and surrounding
   characteristics
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB The importance of human-dominated green spaces for biodiversity support is increasing. With the popularity of rooftop farms to grow healthy and local food, can rooftop farms provide wildlife habitats? This study conducted a year-round survey on eight rooftop farms to reveal (1) plant and faunal species composition and diversity of the rooftop farms, (2) variations in plant and faunal species composition by site and the four seasons, (3) effects of site and surrounding characteristics on faunal species composition and diversity, and (4) examine whether higher taxa was adequate in indicating species-level faunal species composition on rooftop farms. This study used visual observation and pitfall trap methods to conduct a faunal species survey twice a season; and recorded plant species and their blooming status in each survey. Arthropods were the survey target, and Molluscs found in the cultivation area were also recorded. The season averages in plant species number and blooming species were 30-50% and 20-30% of the total number of plant species in a year. Generalist species dominated rooftop farms. Site and seasons significantly affected faunal species composition and diversity. The site characteristics significantly affected the rooftop farms' faunal species composition and diversity, but the surrounding characteristics almost had no effects. The larger rooftop area led to a larger cultivation area, resulting in more plant and blooming species and attracting more faunal species. Humans managed the vegetation on the rooftop farms might form a distinct habitat. Family-level performed well as a surrogate in indicating faunal species-level composition on rooftop farms.

TI Bat Activity Correlates with Moth Abundance on an Urban Green Roof
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
AB Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to habitat loss resulting from urbanization. Urban green roofs may mitigate such habitat loss by providing supplemental habitat for wildlife, including bats, which are more active over urban green roofs than nearby traditional roofs. To better understand bat activity over urban green roofs, we surveyed bats and arthropods on a 27,316-m(2) green roof planted with Sedum spp. in New York City from June to August 2017. We found that Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), a species with a diet consisting mainly of moths, accounted for 88% of identified bat calls. We collected over 15,000 arthropods of 16 taxa and found that moth abundance, while a relatively small proportion of green roof arthropods, correlated positively with bat activity. Our findings suggest that urban green roofs provide useable habitat for moths and other arthropods and, consequently, bats may forage on green roofs when prey are available.

TI Supporting urban greenspace with microbial symbiosis
SO PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET
AB Societal Impact StatementCities are stressful environments for plants, plagued by heat, pollution, and biodiversity loss. As a result, plant communities tend to suffer in green roofs, parks, and living walls. Finding solutions to help plants grow in stressful environments is a goal of the sustainable city. One solution is to better incorporate plant-microbe symbiosis in green architecture. Symbiotic fungi and bacteria can provide nutrients, water, and help plants to cope with urban stress. The reconceptualization of green infrastructure from a microbial-focused perspective has the potential to improve plant health, growth, and diversity in cities.SummaryPlant communities in cities help maintain the health and stability of urban ecosystems and inhabitants. Ensuring that greenspace is healthy and productive is a key goal of green infrastructure and landscape architecture (GILA). However, cities are stressful environments for plants. In natural ecosystems, plants live in symbiosis with fungi, bacteria, and other microbes that can help alleviate stress. Microbial communities may also help with stress associated with urban environments. Incorporating mutualistic symbioses into GILA is a sustainable way to enhance urban greenspace. Here, we address key stressors for GILA in cities, including dependency on fertilizers, pathogens, drought, fewer pollinators, pollution, and reduced plant biodiversity. For each of these stressors, we discuss how symbiotic fungi and bacteria can help mitigate these issues, including case-use scenarios. We conclude with new approaches to deliberately incorporate mutualisms in cities and open dialogues with stakeholders.

TI A habitat analog approach establishes native plant communities on green
   roofs
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Novel habitats can support biodiversity by amending what has been lost through urban development. However, the effects of fragmentation, disturbance, and altered availability of resources in cities can prevent many local plant species from establishing and persisting. Novel habitats like green roofs could be colonized by native plants if species could overcome particularly harsh environmental conditions. To do so, green roofs could be designed using a habitat analog approach wherein natural habitats with similar abiotic characteristics inform the potential species pool. In this study, we tested the efficacy of using a habitat analog approach to establish native plant communities on green roofs. We surveyed vegetation in 18 dry prairies of three subtypes (gravel hill, dolomite, and sand) and planted replicates of two communities (sand prairie and rock prairie, which combined gravel hill and dolomite) on green roofs to determine which prairie was the most suitable analog. We investigated the effect of three environmental variables on plant establishment, survival, and growth: soil continuity (continuous soil vs. isolated trays), planting method (seeds vs. pre-grown seedlings), and the addition of native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We determined the most suitable habitat analog and measured the effect of the environmental variables by conducting vegetation surveys in the experimental roof plots for three years. The experimental rock prairie communities more closely resembled the target than did the sand prairies, supporting the hypothesis that shared soil properties are important for establishing analogous plant communities in novel habitats. At the community level, survival and growth were higher in continuous soil, highlighting the importance of belowground components of constructed habitats. We found no effect of planting method or addition of native AM fungi on plant survival or growth. Overall, our results support using a habitat analog approach to select native species that support biodiversity in constructed novel habitats like green roofs.

TI Introduced and native plant species composition of vacant unmanaged
   green roofs in New York City
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Vacant spaces, such as unplanted, unmanaged, or infrequently accessed green roofs, may play a critical role in sustaining biodiversity in cities. Initial plant composition of these spaces likely is contingent on seed dispersal and growing medium, yet no studies have directly characterized the effects of location or growing medium depth on plant diversity of unplanted green roofs. To address this gap, we studied first-year community composition of five unplanted green roofs in New York City (NY, USA). On each roof, 12 plots were established with media depths ranging from 5 to 13 cm. Four months after installation, all plants were harvested. We observed 29 species across locations; five species were found on all five roofs, while 13 species each were observed on a single roof. Introduced species accounted for 14 of the 29 species found across roofs. Species richness and composition differed among roofs, while functional richness varied within, but not among, roofs. About 80% of the variation in species richness was accounted for by total green space in the neighborhoods within 100 to 200 m of each roof. Functional richness and plant cover increased with increased growing medium depth, as did the relative abundance of annual and forb species. Our results suggest both location and growing medium depth will affect initial community composition of unmanaged green roofs, but with differential effects on community assembly. These results also highlight the potential role of unmanaged vacant roofs as reservoirs of plant diversity, both native and invasive, in urban spaces.

TI Macro-invertebrate abundance on green roofs versus ground level sites in
   the city of Antwerp, Belgium
SO BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB Here, the abundance of macro-invertebrates (Arthropoda and Gastropoda) of eight green roofs and their adjacent ground level habitats in the city of Antwerp, Belgium, is compared. All higher-level taxa found were present in both types of habitats without significant differences in their overall abundance between green roofs and ground level habitats. However, we found significant differences in abundances between the two types of habitats, when specific taxa were compared. Beetles (Coleoptera), isopods (Isopoda) and bees (Anthophila) were more abundant at ground level sites compared to green roofs, while for true bugs (Heteroptera) and cicadas (Auchenorrhyncha) the opposite was found. Our results support the idea that extensive green roofs in Belgium can provide a suitable habitat for different invertebrate taxa, but further research is needed to identify the true drivers behind differences in abundance between ground level and adjacent green roofs.

TI A revised terminology for vegetated rooftops based on function and
   vegetation
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB The proliferation of vegetated, or green roofs, warrant a revisit of the terminology used in order to efficiently, and without confusion, convey information among scientists, policy makers and practitioners. A Web of Science and Google Scholar search (from 1996 to 2018) showed a steady increase in green roof articles, reaching close to 300 per year in WOS and ca. 2500 in Google Scholar, with approximately 10-20%, and up to 40 % of all articles using the terms extensive and/or intensive, especially in recent years. We evaluated the use of these terms, including 'green roof, and 'intensive and extensive roof', found that they are used in confusing ways, and provide compelling evidence that there is a need for revising the terminology. Acknowledging that most, if not all, vegetated roofs are multifunctional, we propose a new classification system based on the roof's primary function(s) and vegetation, such as "stormwater meadow roof", "biodiversity meadow roof", "biodiversity forest roof", or even "multifunctional meadow roof". This new terminological sphere is not meant to be rigid, but should be allowed to evolve so that useful combinations survive the scrutiny of academia and practitioners, while less useful ones go extinct. A clear and standardized terminology will serve to avoid confusion, allow for generalizations and aid in the development of this rapidly-expanding field.

TI Invasion theory as a management tool for increasing native biodiversity
   in urban ecosystems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB Human activity has altered ecosystems in some places to a point where traditional restoration, ecosystem management and conservation interventions might not be feasible. This is especially true in densely populated urban areas if ongoing stressors are not ameliorated. As a result, different management options are needed for increasing native biodiversity and ecosystem function in novel urban ecosystems. One strategy for increasing biodiversity in urban ecosystems is to employ invasion biology theory to augment the establishment and proliferation of desirable native species. Invasion hypotheses, including fluctuating resources, enemy release, novel weapons, invasional meltdown (facilitation) and propagule pressure, all provide insights into the mechanisms that increase the establishment and spread of populations. These hypotheses point to specific interventions that can be used in urban restoration and management. Synthesis and applications. Viewing invasion mechanisms as a way to increase native biodiversity in novel urban ecosystems provides a useful reframing for assessing possible applications and management interventions for the most difficult-to-restore landscapes. We argue that conservation managers can use and test invasion hypotheses to inform biodiversity management practices in novel landscapes.

TI Creating ecologically sound buildings by integrating ecology,
   architecture and computational design
SO PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB 1. Research is revealing an increasing number of positive effects of nature for humans. At the same time, biodiversity in cities, where most humans live, is often low or in decline. Tangible solutions are needed to increase urban biodiversity. 2. Architecture is a key discipline that has considerable influence on the built-up area of cities, thereby influencing urban biodiversity. In general, architects do not design for biodiversity. Conversely, urban conservation planning generally focuses on the limited space free of buildings and does not embrace architecture as an important discipline for the creation of urban green infrastructure. 3. In this paper, we argue that the promotion of biodiversity needs to become a key driving force of architectural design. This requires a new multi-species design paradigm that considers both human and non-human needs. Such a design approach needs to maintain the standards of the architectural profession, including the aim to increase the well-being of humans in buildings. Yet, it also needs to add other stakeholders, organisms such as animals, plants and even microbiota. New buildings designed for humans and other inhabitants can then increase biodiversity in cities and also increase the benefits that humans can derive from close proximity to nature. 4. We review the challenges that this new design approach poses for both architecture and ecology and show that multi-species-design goes beyond existing approaches in architecture and ecology. The new design approach needs to make ecological knowledge available to the architectural design process, enabling practitioners to find architectural solutions that can facilitate synergies from a multi-species perspective. 5. We propose that a first step in creating such a multi-species habitat is the design of buildings with an ecolope, a multi criteria-designed building envelope that takes into account the needs of diverse organisms. Because there is no framework to design such an ecolope, we illustrate how multi-species design needs to draw on knowledge from ecology, as well as architecture, and design computation. 6. We discuss how architectures designed via a multi-species approach can be an important step in establishing beneficial human-nature relationships in cities, and contribute to human well-being and biodiversity conservation.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB To reduce the impact of climate change in the form of low-carbon developments, innovations in sustainable building strategies are imperative. In this regard, the performance of a double-roof house consisting of a photovoltaic panel roof (PV) and green roof (GR) was compared to traditional solar-roof buildings. The synergy between both the PV and GR systems was analysed by numerical simulations and physical modelling across the four seasons. The performance of the systems was assessed on three dimensions: indoor thermal comfort, photovoltaic temperature, and energy yield. The synergy of photovoltaic roofs with green roofs kept the indoor environment 6% more comfortable than solar roofs. The synergy also reduced the photovoltaic temperature by up to 8 & DEG;C, extending the PV life span and increasing the energy yield by 18%.

TI The contribution of seedbank to the green roof plant community dynamics
   analogous to semi-natural grasslands
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Extensive green roofs have been shown to support native biodiversity and plant communities that are analogous to natural or semi-natural habitats such as grasslands. However, little is known about the role of soil seedbanks in the dynamic of extensive green roof plant communities. The purpose of this study was to analyze the seedbank that developed after 4 years of an extensive green roof analog to dry grassland plant community, seeded with 29 species. We aimed to understand the contribution of seedbank to the resilience of vegetation to harsh conditions of the roof and to colonization by surrounding spontaneous species. We monitored the plant species cover in 36 plots during 4 years in June (between 2018 and 2021), and sampled the seedbank in February 2021. Our results showed that the soil seedbank was dominated by transient spontaneous ruderals species, while the standing vegetation was still dominated by seeded grassland species. We found that seeded grassland species had poor seedbank stock, similar to their natural environments. The similarity index between the standing vegetation and the seedbank increased over time, and we measured a significant correlation between dominant species cover and their seedbank density. Spontaneous species cover was not correlated to the proportion of soil not colonized by seeded species cover, indicating that gaps in vegetation did not influence the development of spontaneous species. Our findings highlight the importance of seedbank in the dynamic of green roof vegetation and demonstrate that analogous habitat species exhibit similar behavior as in their natural environments.

TI Native plants on experimental urban green roofs support higher
   community-level insect abundance than exotics
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Urbanization is one of the multiple factors leading to global insect declines. As urbanization grows, green roofs represent a nature-based solution that could provide habitat for plants and animals within cities. Several characteristics of green roofs could enhance insect biodiversity. Nevertheless, little is known about the effects of plant origin on insect abundance from a multi-taxa perspective. Thus, our main goal was to evaluate the effects of plant origin, local resources, and urbanization level on green roofs' overall insect abundance, the abundance of different taxonomic orders, and community composition. Using experimental green roofs, we compared insect communities between native and exotic plants across an urbanization gradient, in C & PRIME;ordoba city, central Argentina. On the roofs of 30 houses, we installed two blocks of a modular extensive green roof system, with either native or exotic plant species (6 species each). In March 2019, we used yellow pan traps and pitfall traps (N = 360) to sample insects and measured flower abundance and plant cover at each plant treatment. The urbanization level of each house was estimated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the Land Surface Temperature (LST). A total of 35,257 insects from 12 orders were registered, with Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera as the dominant groups. Native plants supported significantly higher total insect abundance on both types of traps, independently from the urbanization level, flower abundance, or plant cover of each roof. The abundance of most of the taxonomic orders was higher in natives as well, but particular effects of the covariables were detected for certain groups. In addition, plant origin was an important factor for insect composition. Our results highlight that green roof design should prioritize native plants to enhance insect conservation while achieving more sustainable cities.

TI The role of green roofs in post COVID-19 confinement: An analysis of
   willingness to pay
SO JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB Urban population is becoming less likely to contact with nature. Yet, green infrastructure, as green roofs, provide multiple ecosystem services, as promoting citizens physical and psychological well-being. With the Comnavirus 19 world pandemic public spaces, like parks and other recreational areas, were closed and most citizens were confined to their dwellings. In this context, the need for outdoor space in the housing environment became more necessary than ever. This study is based on a survey performed to citizens living in 35 different countries to identify their access and value given to existing green areas in the home environment during and after confinement, and their willingness to pay (WTP) for an accessible green roof. Results indicate that 68% of respondents missed having a garden during the confinement and the outdoor space value increased after the confinement. Most are willing to pay for a medium sized accessible green roof and their WTP increases if the green area is bigger. WTP for medium sized green roofs is higher in other countries than in Portugal but not significantly different for larger green roofs. To promote private investment in green roofs, citizens WTP should be considered when designing new urban green infrastructure incentive policies.

TI Effects of biodiversity in green roofs and walls on the capture of fine
   particulate matter
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Exposure to ambient PM2.5 poses serious threats to human health. In such cases, the presence of green roofs (GRs) and green walls (GWs) has several environmental benefits, including the capture of pollutants. Choosing appropriate designs of GWs and GRs to improve urban air quality is challenging because their performances depend on their constituent species and environmental characteristics of the particular locality. Capture of PM2.5 by different plant species of GRs and GWs has been measured only on monocultures. The impact of planting different species together (polycultures) on capturing PM2.5 remains unexplored. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of biodiverse GRs and GWs on PM2.5 capture. Seven species were analyzed as polycultures: Sedum album, Lampranthus spectabillis, Sedum spurium P, Lavandula angustifolia, Erigeron karvinskianus, Aptenia cordifolia, and Sedum palmeri. PM2.5 capture was measured by two methods: gravimetric determination and decay curve. Gravimetric results suggest that higher the biodiversity of plants in GRs and GWs, higher the PM2.5 capture, particularly for species with relatively low capture when used as monocultures. The ability to capture PM2.5 is dependent on the plant species, relative position of plants within the polyculture, and horizontal (GRs) or vertical (GWs) layout. Decay method results suggest that polycultures could be more effective in long-term reduction of high PM2.5  concentrations.

TI Green Roofs, Vegetation Types, Impact on the Thermal Effectiveness: An
   Experimental Study in Cyprus
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Anthropogenic activities and climate change have a profound impact on the urban environment. Therefore, energy conservation is an important subject for city planners. Green roofs can provide building insulation and mitigate against the urban heat island effect. This research was conducted in Cyprus, comparing different types of green roof vegetation against a control roof with no vegetation and their concomitant effects on indoor temperatures. The research project was performed at Near East University Campus for duration of twelve months. The experiment consisted of three different green roof types, and each hut with green roof had 3.5 m(2) roof areas with a soil depth of 8 cm. In addition, one control green roof system was established without insulation, without soil, and without vegetation. In order to measure the indoor temperatures of the huts, Elitech RC-5 temperature data loggers were used. The research results showed that green roof huts provided lower mean temperatures than the control hut during the summer period. Most importantly, huts with shrub plants had the lowest temperatures during hot summer conditions. Our results indicated that green roofs perform an important role in terms of building insulation and its subsequent energy use.

TI Improving access to greenspaces in the Mediterranean city of Faro
SO AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Green infrastructure has received increasing attention in urban strategies in a sustainable and resilience context, since greenspaces provide diverse ecosystem services. Green roofs can be a form of compensating the loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity in urban areas, contribute to safe access to greenspaces, which is important in times of social isolation, due to viral pandemics, and can guarantee self-reliance food. Thus, this urban measure should be integrated in urban planning and management, by using urban indicators associated with citizens access to greenspaces. Hence, we study pedestrian accessibility to green areas and propose an urban solution to improve access to greenspaces. The assessment is developed using indicators related to the citizens living in the surroundings of green areas and the residential buildings that exist in these areas; the residents living in potential green buildings or blocks with private green roofs and the potential green buildings with private green roofs. The ideal standard distances were considered to analyze the proximity of green areas to the dwellings of residents. We used GIS for the assessment of distances over the pedestrian network. The results indicate the necessity of building green roofs through the private sector. The developed indicators provide an important contribution to the municipal management in the definition of criteria for the urban location of green roofs to promote better access to ecosystem services.

TI ROLE OF EXTENSIVE GREEN ROOFS IN WATER MANAGEMENT IN URBAN DRAINAGE
   SYSTEMS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB Roof areas represent a significant part of the surfaces in city centers, where space for new drainage infrastructure (channels, storage tanks etc.) is limited. In these areas, green roofs have become a popular technique for implementation of sustainable urbanism concept. Green roofs are used the most common for stormwater mitigation but there are other benefits: reduce energy consumption and air pollution, decrease urban heat island effect, increase biodiversity and roof life. The paper is focused on characteristics of green roofs in the quantitative management of storm water: the reduction of the runoff volume, the peak attenuation and delay at the rainfall event. There are many factors affecting the hydrological performance of green roofs: local climate conditions, substrate depth and composition, drainage layer, type of vegetation cover, rainfall pattern, thus the influence on the drainage infrastructure is uncertain.. The results of numerous hydrodynamic simulations showed a significant impact of the use of green roofs on the performance of drainage infrastructure (storage tanks and channels).

AB The article presents the assessment of 14 solutions most often used for supporting water circulation in residential areas. They were valorized in relation to the spatial and functional aspects. The results were derived using the scoring method and allowed for the identification of the value of the studied solutions on three levels: high (rain gardens, street side bioretention basins), medium (green roofs, infiltration wells, infiltration trenches and grassed swales, grassed retention and infiltration basins, permeable pavements, and infiltration boxes), and low (wetland ponds, sealed surface and underground water reservoirs, and water squares). Sustainable water management in housing estates requires a conscious selection of blue and green infrastructure solutions based on their individual features. The implementation of solutions assessed as more valuable may increase the impact of these areas in mitigating the negative effects of climate change and support the aims of the European Green Deal strategy.

TI Mandatory or voluntary approaches to green roof implementation: a
   comparative study among some global cities
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Green roofs can deliver multiple environmental and social benefits by reducing the urban heat island effect, reducing building energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, providing habitat for biodiversity and access to the biophilia effect. Green roofs provide these benefits to differing degrees in different climate zones globally. Despite known benefits, uptake of green roofs has been slow. Different cities, globally, adopt various policies and programmes to increase their green roofs; the question is which approach is best? This research used an in-depth review, site visits and qualitative methods, to determine whether mandatory or voluntary approaches produced greater uptake. Green roof policies and practices from selected global cities, London, Toronto, Singapore, Rotterdam and Stockholm, Sydney and Melbourne were examined. Singapore's voluntary approach led to the greater uptake of green roofs. The mandatory approach taken by Toronto, with financial grants provided meaningful outcomes. London and Rotterdam implemented useful voluntary programmes, and Stockholm required more time to evaluate the effectiveness of its voluntary approaches in increasing green roofs. A voluntary approach for retrofit and a mandatory approach for new build developments are suggested as recommendations for Australian cities. Given the increases in green roofs internationally, similar increases can occur in Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, and these findings may be transferable to other global cities investigating different approaches to the increased adoption of retrofitted green roofs.

TI Scaling up nature-based solutions for climate-change adaptation:
   Potential and benefits in three European cities
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Many exemplary projects have demonstrated that Nature-based Solutions (NBS) can contribute to climate change adaptation, but now the challenge is to scale up their use. Setting realistic policy goals requires knowing the amount of different NBS types that can fit in the urban space and the benefits that can be expected. This research aims to assess the potential for a full-scale implementation of NBS for climate-change adaptation in European cities, the expected benefits and co-benefits, and how these quantities relate to the urban structure of the cities. We selected three case studies: Barcelona (Spain), Malmo (Sweden), and Utrecht (the Netherlands), and developed six scenarios that simulate the current condition, the full-scale implementation of different NBS strategies (i.e., installing green roofs, de-sealing parking areas, enhancing vegetation in urban parks, and planting street trees), and a combination of them. Then we applied spatially-explicit methods to assess, for each scenario, two climate change-related benefits, i.e. heat mitigation and stormwater regulation, and three co benefits, namely carbon storage, biodiversity potential, and overall greenness. Finally, by breaking down the results per land use class, we investigated how the potential and benefits vary depending on the urban form. Most scenarios provide multiple benefits, but each one is characterized by a specific mix. In all cities, a full-scale deployment of green roofs shows the greatest potential to reduce runoff and increase biodiversity, while tree planting-either along streets or in urban parks- produces the greatest impact on heat mitigation and greenness. However, these results entail interventions of different size and in different locations. Planting street trees maximizes interventions in residential areas, but key opportunities for integrating most NBS types also lie in commercial and industrial areas. The results on the pros and cons of each scenario can support policy-makers in designing targeted NBS strategies for climate change adaptation.

TI Urbanites' perception of vegetation in landscape-based stormwater
   management elements (LSM)
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB The popularity and use of green infrastructure measures such as green roofs, green walls, and curb extensions is growing, especially in dense urban areas. At the same time, from an ecosystem services perspective, interest in urban nature and reconciliation ecology is underlined. Attempts to introduce more biodiverse vegetation in cities can conflict with the responses of some urbanites to the appearance of "wild" vegetation. Through semi-structured interviews with 47 randomly picked bypassers in Copenhagen, Denmark, this study explored urbanites' aesthetical perceptions of wild vegetation, especially of three green infrastructure types employed in landscape-based stormwater management: green roofs, green walls and curb extensions. The results confirm the importance of the physical plant properties, especially the color of plants and the presence of flowers; they point also to the strong influence of cultural factors, especially familiarity with a site or a similar project, and knowledge of the project's environmental value. Interestingly, the results indicate that cultural factors might be capable of garnering support for a project among people whose initial impression of its appearance was negative. Additionally, affective and emotive responses were found to be of significance. Compared to other studies, perceptions of wild vegetation in green infrastructure elements prove to be perceived more positively than reported previously.

TI Multilayer blue-green roofs as nature-based solutions for water and
   thermal insulation management
SO HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
AB Green roofs have been widely recognized as sustainable nature-based solutions to mitigate floods in urban areas, which, in the last decades, are increasing due to the combination of intense worldwide urbanization and climate change. Besides flood mitigation, green roofs provide additional benefits for the urban environment (e.g., reducing the urban heat island and ensuring energy saving for the underneath building). Moreover, green roofs facilitate the increase of urban biodiversity, attracting different species of small animals, and upgrade the city aesthetic value. Among the different types of green roofs, multilayer blue-green roofs present an additional layer to store water during rainfall events. As part of the Polder Roof field lab project, prototypes of multilayer blue-green roof developed by the Dutch company Metropolder were installed in four Italian cities: Cagliari, Palermo, Perugia, and Viterbo. The four prototypes and the experimental set up are described and the potential benefits of this innovative solution are discussed. Preliminary analyses, from December 2020 to December 2021, enable to estimate runoff reduction and thermal properties of multilayer blue-green roofs, underlying the high potential of this nature-based solution, which allows to retain most of the rainfall events and to mitigate the daily temperature variability.

TI Public Perceptions of Green Roofs and Green Walls in Tokyo, Japan: A
   Call to Heighten Awareness
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Many cities advocate retrofitting green roofs and green walls (GRGW) to create additional green areas, especially in cramped urban areas. Yet, worldwide, only a handful of studies have evaluated the public views towards the benefits and negative issues and promotion policies of this innovative greening option. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a survey (N = 500) of residents' opinions towards GRGW in Tokyo, a city with mandatory installation of GRGW for almost two decades. Respondents mostly agreed with the contribution of GRGW to thermal comfort, air quality, and cityscape but weakly endorsed other potential benefits. High costs as well as mosquitoes and plant litter nuisances were the most recognized negative issues. Mandatory installation was the least preferred promotion policy. Instead, respondents expected installation on public buildings and provision of installation guidance. Respondents predominantly held a "moderate" view towards both the benefits and negative issues, showing indifferent attitudes towards GRGW. Income level and housing type shaped the overall perceptions, whereas age, sex, and current living environment influenced perceptions of individual aspects. Our findings signified a need for a bottom-up strategy to heighten public awareness for the advanced development of GRGW to complement and prime the top-down mandatory installation policy.

TI Interactive spatial planning of urban green infrastructure -
   Retrofitting green roofs where ecosystem services are most needed in
   Oslo
SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly being used to inform urban green infrastructure planning. We explore the use of modern cloud computing technologies (Google Earth Engine) to facilitate public access to spatial MCDA of ecosystem services from green infrastructure. Using the spatial prioritization of green roof retrofitting in Oslo, Norway, as a case study, we present a web application that is a generalizable tool for engaging stakeholders in spatial planning of ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions. In our application, green roof designers, owners and operators identified the relative importance of a suite of potential ecosystem services (ES) gained from retrofitting of green roofs, conditional on preference profiles expected by users of different building functional types. The ES assessed included temperature regulation, stormwater runoff mitigation, habitat for biodiversity, aesthetic value, and noise reduction. In Oslo we found high spatial correlation in ES deficits, implying that even large differences in stakeholder preferences for individual ES will lead MCDA to identify common interests in the spatial targeting of green roofs. Nevertheless, we found the interactive spatial MCDA web application to have potential for improving planning process efficiency in engaging stakeholders. In more heterogenous urban landscapes, with lower spatial correlation of individual ES, spatial MCDA also has scope to improve the output efficiency of spatial targeting of nature-based solutions such as green roofs.

TI Planning of Urban Green Spaces: An Ecological Perspective on Human
   Benefits
SO LAND
AB In the context of urban land-use growth and the consequent impacts on the environment, green spaces provide ecosystem services for human health. The ecosystem services concept synthesises human-environmental interactions through a series of combined components of biodiversity and abiotic elements, linking ecological processes and functions. The concept of green infrastructure (GI) in the urban context emphasises the quality and quantity of urban and peri-urban green spaces and natural areas. In dense urban contexts, the applications of GI are limited and not applied to the potential urban spaces such as roofs and gardens. Often, roofs are characterised by impermeable paved surfaces with negative effects on human well-being, whereas garden designs do not consider social needs and environmental interactions. The role of urban stressors or the urban context as a driving force or pressure of urban green space is not always well understood and employed in the planning of green spaces. This is partly due to a knowledge gap between different science disciplines that operate on different scales, from single processes of the plants (which focus on plant responses to environmental stresses affecting human well-being) to urban ecosystems (which focus on the biodiversity and urban space planning-human well-being relationship). This can create a paradox, as green spaces that are not adequately designed might not produce the expected effects. In this paper, an overview of benefits and limitations of applying the ecosystem services approach when designing green spaces is presented. The focus is on the main urban ecosystem services provided by green roofs and community gardens such as GI that can represent strategies to provide ecological and social multifunctionality to waterproofed surfaces connected to the buildings and low-exploited gardens being the main areas that affect dense urban settlements, and thus, increasing the ecosystem services in the urban environment, such as reducing the Urban Heat Island, as well as flooding events. Specifically, the paper highlights (i) feedback between ecological processes and functions that support ecosystem services, (ii) urban environmental stresses in relation to disservices that these can create for human well-being and (iii) key issues that should be considered in the planning and design of urban ecosystem services. Such a new vision of urban ecosystem services highlights the need to look at GI as an active part of the urban space design in the built environment.

TI Green roofs in the tropics: design considerations and vegetation
   dynamics
SO HELIYON
AB Green roofs (GR) have been proposed as a possible solution for urban stressors that, integrated with other remediation and mitigation actions, can lead the way to a more sustainable society. Even when some aspects of green roof design are well established and known (i.e. depth arrangements, materials, structural components, etc.) there is a need for further development on ecological attributes. This study is a descriptive analysis of suitable plant species for their possible incorporation in green roof designs with tropical climate conditions. Green roof research has been mostly led by temperate climate countries and has neglected to address tropical areas; this study aims to move research towards this knowledge gap. The evaluation of the vegetation dynamics in these novel ecosystems was done through a case study in the renovated facilities of the International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, which incorporated a set of green roofs in their infrastructure. We also sampled an older green roof built in the Social Sciences Faculty at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras. A three-dimensional approach, the Point-Intercept Method, was taken in the vegetation surveys to capture as much as possible the green infrastructure of the roofs. Most of the originally planted species did not appear in these surveys. On the contrary, mainly new species dominated the areas. Along with the findings of these surveys and those in other tropical countries, a list of suitable species for green roofs in Puerto Rico is suggested, and some general recommendations are made for the better management of green roofs in tropical zones.

TI Role of green roofs in urban connectivity, an exploratory approach using
   landscape graphs in the city of Paris, France
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Green roofs provide many ecosystem services, but little is known about the way they contribute to urban functional connectivity. This paper has the following four objectives: (1) to compare the potential green roofs' role to connectivity in relation to other urban green spaces, (2) to specify the green roofs contribution's type, (3) to explore the influence of building height integration method and finally (4) to assess the impact on connectivity of simulated greening new roofs. Using a landscape graph approach, we modeled ecological networks of three species groups with different dispersion capacities in the Paris region (France). Then, we computed several connectivity metrics to assess the potential contribution of green roofs to functional connectivity. At a large scale (metropole scale), our results show that green roofs can slightly improve the global connectivity largely through the connections rather than the addition of habitat area. More than a stepping stone function, green roofs would have a dispersion flux function at a local scale. Furthermore, when the difficulty of crossing movement is exponential to the height of buildings, green roofs over 20 m high are mostly disconnected from the ecological networks. In addition to the green roof's height, our analysis highlights the very strong role played by buildings' configuration. This study raises promising directions for the integration of building height into the analysis of urban connectivity. Detailed research and long-term biological data from green roofs and green spaces are needed to confirm our results.

TI Protection against summer overheating due to greening in the built
   environment
SO BAUPHYSIK
AB Due to climate change, the average summer climate in Germany gets hotter. The greening of outdoor facilities and buildings reduces the urban heat island effect and improves the micro-climate. If this has a significant effect on the protection against summer overheating and the indoor thermal comfort of highly insulated buildings, is so far unknown. This question is investigated by coupling the thermal-dynamic building simulation software IDA ICE with the micro-climate simulation software ENVI-MET. The investigation was carried out using a typical residential area in Germany. In comparison to conventional buildings and gardens with only lawn, the planting of shrubs and trees in combination with extensive roof greening and moss facades enhances the protection against summer overheating on a hot day by up to 20 %. Through an appropriate plant selection the greening leads to an enhanced biodiversity and a better air quality, which is not possible, using conventional measures for the protection against summer overheating.

TI On the Energy Performance of an Innovative Green Roof in the
   Mediterranean Climate
SO ENERGIES
AB Green roofs have a thermal insulating effect known since ancient times. In the building sector, green roofs represent a sustainable passive solution to obtain energy savings, both during winter and summer. Moreover, they are a natural barrier against noise pollution, reducing sound reflections, and they contribute to clean air and biodiversity in urban areas. In this research, a roof-lawn system was studied through a long experimental campaign. Heat-flow meters, air and surface temperature sensors were used in two buildings characterized by different surrounding conditions, geometries and orientations. In both case studies, the thermal behaviors of the roof-lawn system were compared with the conventional roofs. In addition, a dynamic simulation model was created in order to quantify the effect of this green system on the heating and cooling energy demands. The roof-lawn showed a high thermal inertia, with no overheating during summer, and a high insulating capacity, involving energy savings during winter, and consequently better indoor thermal conditions.

TI Developing a blue-green infrastructure (BGI) community engagement
   framework template
SO URBAN DESIGN INTERNATIONAL
AB There is growing recognition that Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) (parklands, swales, ponds and green roofs, etc.) can reduce flood-risk and also benefit public health and improve environmental quality (air/water quality, biodiversity, etc.). Community engagement is critical to getting BGI implementation 'right' and producing more sustainable solutions, yet understandings of approaches differ and remain difficult to harmonize or resolve. A review of the extant literature shows that many guidelines frame communities in the passive 'recipient' mode, and remain quiet about the power relations framing and conditioning engagement. The paper then proposes a set of generic template principles for the development of community engagement frameworks to facilitate and encourage greater community co-production of BGI, with the hope that this could then improve public preferences, accountability, efficacy and sustainability.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB Air pollution is regarded as an increasingly threatening, major environmental risk for human health. Seven million deaths are attributed to air pollution each year, 91% of which is due to particulate matter. Vegetation is a xenobiotic means of removing particulate matter. This review presents the mechanisms of PM capture by plants and factors that influence PM reduction in the atmosphere. Vegetation is ubiquitously approved as a PM removal solution in cities, taking various forms of green infrastructure. This review also refers to the effectiveness of plant exploitation in GI: trees, grasslands, green roofs, living walls, water reservoirs, and urban farming. Finally, methods of increasing the PM removal by plants, such as species selection, biodiversity increase, PAH-degrading phyllospheric endophytes, transgenic plants and microorganisms, are presented.

TI Green Roofs and Walls Design Intended to Mitigate Climate Change in
   Urban Areas across All Continents
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green roofs and walls can mitigate the environmental and climate change of a city. They can decrease the urban heat island (UHI), reduce greenhouse gas emissions, fix environmental pollutants, manage urban stormwater runoff, attenuate noise, and enhance biodiversity. This paper aims to analyse green roofs and walls in the possible mitigation of urban climate change and compare it by continent. Green roofs and walls might decrease the air temperature in a city up to 11.3 degrees C and lower the thermal transmittance into buildings up to 0.27 W/m(2) K. Urban greening might sequester up to 375 g C center dot m(-2) per two growing seasons and increase stormwater retention up to 100%. Urban greening might attenuate city noise up to 9.5 dB. The results found green roofs and walls of varied effectiveness in ameliorating climate extremes present in host continents. Results show urban planners might focus on green roofs and walls exposure to attenuate temperatures in hotter Asian cities and advise greening in cities in Africa and Asia. European and American designers might optimise runoff water capacity of green roofs and walls systems and use greening in old buildings to improve insulation. Recommendations are made based on the study to concentrate certain designs to have greater impact on priority climate challenges, whether UHI or stormwater related. This study provides information for decision and policymakers regarding design and exposure of green roofs and walls to mitigate urban environmental and climate change.

TI The role of green roofs in urban Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem nexus: A
   review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Green roofs are strategic tools that can play a significant role in the creation of sustainable and resilient cities. They have been largely investigated thanks to their high retention capacity, which can be a valid support to mitigate the pluvial flood risk and to increase the building thermal insulation, ensuring energy saving. Moreover, green roofs contribute to restoring vegetation in the urban environment, increasing the biodiversity and adding aesthetic value to the city. The new generation of multilayer green roofs present an additional layer with respect to traditional ones, which allows rainwater to be stored, which, if properly treated, can be reused for different purposes. This paper offers a review of benefits and limitations of green roofs, with a focus on multilayer ones, within a Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem nexus context. This approach enables the potential impact of green roofs on the different sectors to be highlighted, investigating also the interactions and interconnections among the fields. Moreover, the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem nexus approach highlights how the installation of traditional and multilayer green roofs in urban areas contributes to the Development Goals defined by the 2030 Sustainable Agenda.

TI Green roof ecosystem services in various urban development types: A case
   study in Graz, Austria
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB In this paper, we describe how different urban development types and environmental conditions could affect the broad distribution of green roofs in Graz (Austria). A GIS-based mapping method was applied along the lines of four ecosystem services (i.e., regulation of microclimate temperature regulation, support of air quality improvement support, stormwater retention and biodiversity enhancement). The results are rather positive and indicate that green roofs are fit on 87 % of the investigated roof area (172 out of 203 buildings) based on roof dimensions and constructional measures. Among the investigated roof area, 63 % was classified as having a 'high need' for greening and, thus, a need to generate ecosystem services in urban environments. These results present a paradox: Roofs on block and row development are more appropriate for greening purposes than roofs on historical perimeter block development, but the latter is often found in environments where green roofs are needed more (i.e., inner-city centres). Therefore, city planners should consider using different greening strategies for distinct urban development types under diverse environmental conditions and prioritise the greening actions accordingly. These findings may be relevant in other historically grown, centrally compact European cities.

TI Tree species composition, growing space and management in Hong Kong's
   commercial sky gardens
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Sky gardens, a type of above-ground urban green space, have been increasingly welcomed and installed in cities. However, few studies have assessed tree planting, management and health in high-rise greenery. This study investigated tree species composition, planting space design and management, and their relationships with tree health in sky gardens in 15 commercial sky gardens with 480 trees in Hong Kong. We assessed the differences between old and new sites regarding tree species, height, crown diameter, and health. We also evaluated selected planting and management factors, including planter type, distance to neighbor trees, root-growth obstacles, canopy barriers, canopy overlap and topping history. Tree species selection in commercial sky gardens was substantially different from public and private residential green spaces. Older sky gardens had more palm trees by species and tree counts. Newer gardens had increased adoption of broadleaf and conifer species with high ornamental value and compact form but fewer native tree species and lower species diversity. The widely planted Ficus spp. had created long-term management issues. Trees were often densely planted, particularly in newer sky gardens. The common practice of topping indicates poor species selection and mismanagement. Planter types with insufficient growing space had dampened tree health. Our findings reveal the trend of tree species adoption, narrower planting spaces and wider adoption of the sunken planter. Improvements in species selection, growing space design and management practices could promote healthy, stable and safe trees in sky gardens with contributions to biodiversity and other ecosystem services.

TI Interactions between buildings, building stakeholders and animals: A
   scoping review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The preservation of biodiversity is a rising global concern and will have a major impact on the design and management of buildings and their immediate surroundings. Thus far, the majority of work on biodiversity and the built environment appears to focus on urban planning, project development, and the niche area of designing buildings with living walls and green roofs. Knowledge on the specific interaction between individual buildings and animals is fragmented, preventing holistic efforts to better manage these interactions. This paper presents the findings from a scoping study which captures the state-of-the-art about relationships between individual buildings, building stakeholders, and animals. It reviews the current body of knowledge and points out three areas of interest that are crucial for future work on this area of study: (1) different stakeholder perspectives of building stakeholders on animals in and around buildings (2) positive and negative interactions between individual buildings and their immediate surroundings with animals and (3) management of interactions between animals in and around buildings. Findings show that literature in relation to these three aspects is fragmented and contains multiple gaps in relation to which species need to be considered and how, including a total absence of mathematical models able to represent animal-building interactions. It calls for better engagement between built environment researchers and their counterparts in biological sciences to collect appropriate data and extract relevant information from it, enhancing knowledge on complex biological processes towards producing shared understanding and developing integrated actions.

TI Can microbial inoculants boost soil food webs and vegetation development
   on newly constructed extensive green roofs?
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Green roofs are a key to providing nature-based solutions in cities. However, most green roofs installed in the Northern hemisphere are shallow, stonecrop planted systems ("extensive" green roofs), which have been shown to support limited biodiversity and could be more effective at providing ecosystem services. One issue with this type of extensive green roof is that rootzones are almost sterile on construction, relying on natural colonisation to provide a soil food web. This is a slow process, meaning plant growth can also be slow. Our aim was to determine if a soil food web could be introduced when the green roof is built. We applied microbial inoculants (mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria (Bacillus spp.)) to a new green roof and monitored plant growth and the soil food web (bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi and microarthropods). Different inoculants altered the composition of microarthropod communities, potentially impacting later succession. In particular, bacterial inoculants increased microarthropod populations. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that the addition of microbial inoculants impacts not only plant growth, but also faunal components of the soil food web, which could have implications for long-term resilience. Bacteria were effective at aiding mycorrhizal colonisation of plants roots, but this colonisation had no impact on the growth of our selected stonecrops, Sedum album, Petrosedum reflexum and Phedimus spurius. We suggest that if a beneficial mycorrhiza could be found to promote the growth of these specific species on green roofs, bacteria could be effective "helper" species to aid colonisation. This study enables green roof researchers and the industry to justify further exploration of the impact of microbial inoculants on green roofs.

TI Identifying the right building roofs for greening from the perspective
   of socio-ecological demands in a 3D urban landscape
SO LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB The multiple benefits of green roofs (GRs) for people and biodiversity conservation in a highly urbanized area are widely confirmed, however, how to identify the right building roofs in a built-up city from the perspective of socio-ecological demands to apply greening is still lacking. In this paper, with the support of the LiDAR 3D point clouds, high-resolution satellite image and socio-economic data, we proposed a systematic approach to identify and prioritize the building roofs for greening by integrating the roof physical structure attributes and socio-ecological demands on the GRs. The suitable buildings for roof greening in the central city of Nanjing, China were first specified on account of the building age and physical structure attributes e.g. height and roof slope, and the other-limited attributes e.g. protected area for historical and cultural heritage, and then a comprehensive framework for assessing roof greening priority was proposed by integrating the building attributes and the socio-ecological demands. The results showed that the total potential suitable area for roof greening is 2879.62hm(2), which accounts for 46.60% of all building roofs. The order of priority installing green roofs is spatial heterogeneous, and the area of high-priority level to install GRs is 629.93hm(2). These results can be used to guide and promote the construction of green roofs in Nanjing, and the developed comprehensive framework to identify the building roofs for greening is also broadly applicable and can be used for other cities.

TI Do small green roofs have the possibility to offer recreational and
   experiential benefits in a dense urban area? A case study in Helsinki,
   Finland
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Growing and densifying cities set challenges for preserving and enhancing sufficient and good quality green urban environment. Rooftops offer vacant room for additional urban greening that may contribute to the well-being of people and the liveability of cities, but this potential lacks empirical support. In spite of the fact that even small green spaces produce, for example restorative experiences, the literature concerning the experiential and recreational benefits of green roofs is still scarce. To identify the experiential potential of a small urban green roof we explored restorative and other experiences of 178 people visiting a sparsely vegetated green roof in the centre of Helsinki, Finland, using a questionnaire. We showed that the studied green roof provided restorative and other positive experiences to the visitors. The level of perceived restorativeness was relatively high. In addition, the results revealed multiple perceived qualities that reflected visual as well as other sensory experiences, beauty, suitability of the place for oneself and the urban context, nature, desire to explore the place and interestedness, positive excitement, and safety. Furthermore, answers to the open questions revealed a wide range of other observations and feelings, such as peace, joy, excitement and hope. Our study indicates that even a small and rather ascetic accessible green roof has potential to offer a moment of respite in the middle of urban everyday hassle, thus implying that these kinds of solutions may allow for a pinch of beneficial green in places where more diverse and lusher solutions are not possible due to, e.g. the load capacity of a roof.

TI Ant species richness in the urban mosaic: size is more important than
   location
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Urban environments are one of the fastest growing habitats in the world. We collected ants to study community composition in three urban engineered habitats; city parks, green rooftops, and street medians in Chicago. We addressed two questions about how ant communities respond to the urban mosaic based on the observation that human disturbance increases from green rooftops to urban parks to street medians; first we studied if ant communities on green rooftops, urban parks, and street medians differed or if different types of urban greenspace have similar communities. We determined that different habitats contain distinct communities. Second, we predicted that area would impact species richness in the same way in different habitats. We found that the area of a habitat predicts species richness and community composition but the pattern was not the same in each habitat. Street medians had more ant species than urban parks, which had more species than green rooftops. On average urban parks were larger than street medians which were larger than green rooftops. Ant community composition on green rooftops differed from city parks and street medians, and showed the greatest variability within a given habitat. After accounting for area, isolation from other sites was also a significant predictor of variation in ant community structure. These findings reinforce that urban ecosystems cannot be considered as one large habitat, but would be better approached as a mosaic of interconnected habitats.

TI <i>Sedum</i> as host plants for caterpillars? Introducing gut content
   metabarcoding to green roof research
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Insect populations are declining due to a multitude of causes. One major cause is the loss of suitable habitat. Recently, green roofs have been investigated for their potential to mitigate this loss of habitat in urbanized environments. In Belgium, most installed green roofs are characterized by a thin layer of mineral substrate and a vegetational composition that is mainly dominated by species of Sedum, i.e. extensive Sedum-moss roofs or Sedum-moss-herbaceous planting. Lepidoptera, as well as many other insects, exert specific plant-herbivore interactions during at least one phase in their life cycle, but no attention has been paid to investigate the potential of Sedum to serve as host plants. Using a molecular approach, we identified caterpillar communities on both types of extensive green roofs and investigated their gut contents. Ten nocturnal moth species were identified: eight polyphagous macromoths and two monophagous micromoths. All species were found to feed on Sedum, a first record thereof for every species. Based on these findings we conclude that both types of green roofs provide larval habitat for at least some moth species. This can have broad implications considering the fact that moths play a crucial role in multiple trophic interactions. However, when the goal is to increase butterfly diversity in urban environments, other types of green roofs need to be reconsidered. While we did not observe larvae of diurnal butterfly species, there have been reports of imagines on wildflower green roofs or biodiverse (semi-)intensive green roofs.

TI Seasonal patterns of native plant cover and leaf trait variation on New
   York City green roofs
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Plants make important contributions to green roof ecosystem service provision through evapotranspiration, canopy shading, and water retention. Because these plant communities are a critical component of green roof design and function, both seasonal and interspecific variation of these plant communities are important factors in evaluating green roof performance. This study examines variation in both species abundance and 9 leaf traits throughout the 2015 growing season of four New York City green roofs. While community composition varied significantly between each month (p(ANOSIM) = 0.036), three major plant families (Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, and Poaceae) consistently had the greatest green cover and were present during the entirety of the growing season. For leaf traits, period of the growing season had a significant impact on most of the traits measured. Leaf thickness, leaf relative water content (RWC) and saturated water content (SWC) decreased as the growing season progressed, while leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and stomatal density increased, likely due to a seasonal decrease in rainfall as species-level variance in these water traits is low (7.40% and 0.88%, respectively). We also ranked planted and spontaneous species in accordance to both cover and functional trait values, and identified 11 species suitable for green roofs in NYC: Pycnanthemum tenuifolium (Lamiaceae), Symphiotrichum leave, Symphiotrichum pilosum, Rudbeckia hirta, Solidago odora (Asteraceae), Panicum virgatum, Sorghastrum nutrans, Schizachyrium scoparium, Dichanthelium clandestinum, Deschampsia flexuosa (Poaceae), and Oenothera biennis (Onagraceae). Understanding the temporal responses of plant communities and their constituent species is critical in optimizing green roof ecosystem services.

TI Green roofs and pollinators, useful green spots for some wild bee
   species (Hymenoptera: Anthophila), but not so much for hoverflies
   (Diptera: Syrphidae)
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Urbanisation has become one of the major anthropogenic drivers behind insect decline in abundance, biomass and species richness over the past decades. As a result, bees and other pollinators' natural habitats are reduced and degraded. Green roofs are frequently recommended as ways to counter the negative impacts of urbanisation on nature and enhance the amount of green space in cities. In this study we evaluated the pollinator (more specifically wild bees and hoverflies) diversity, abundance and species richness on twenty green roofs in Antwerp, Belgium. We analysed the influence of roof characteristics (age, surface area, height, percent cover of green space surrounding each site) on species richness or abundance of pollinators. In total we found 40 different wild bee species on the green roofs. None of the physical roof characteristics appear to explain differences in wild bees species richness and abundance. Neither could we attribute the difference in roof vegetation cover, i.e. roofs build-up with only Sedum species and roofs with a combined cover of Sedum, herbs and grasses, to differences in diversity, abundance, or species richness. We found a positive trend, although not significant, in community weighted mean body size for wild bees with an increase in green roof surface area. Roof wild bee communities were identified as social polylectic individuals, with a preference for ground nesting. Only eleven individuals from eight different hoverfly species were found. Our results show that green roofs can be a suitable habitat for wild bee species living in urban areas regardless of the roofs' characteristics, but hoverflies have more difficulties conquering these urban green spaces.

TI Simulating the Hydrological Impact of Green Roof Use and an Increase in
   Green Areas in an Urban Catchment with i-Tree: A Case Study with the
   Town of Fontibon in Bogota, Colombia
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB Urbanization has produced various social, environmental, and hydrological impacts, such as reduced biodiversity, increased urban temperatures, ecosystem degradation, air and water pollution, changes to hydrological processes, groundwater recharge alterations, increased prevalence of floods, vegetation removal, and potential increases in unstable soils. Finding solutions to mitigate the impacts of urbanization is of vital importance in the development and planning of cities, and particularly so for developing countries. One strategy gaining momentum is the use of green roofs and larger green areas (greater green cover under trees, with the purpose of increasing the permeable area) for runoff control. In this study, a simulation was carried out using the i-Tree Hydro software that involved the urban basin in the Fontibon area of Bogota, Colombia, with the aim of observing the hydrological benefits of trees, green areas, and permeable zones. Five scenarios were proposed in which green roof coverage was implemented (20% and 50% increases in green areas in Scenarios 1 and 2), coverage under existing trees was enhanced (50% and 100% increase in Scenarios 4 and 5), and finally a complete removal of green zones in Fontibon was simulated (Scenario 3). The town is relatively susceptible to a reduction in its existing green areas, with an increase in total flow of more than 50% for one scenario considered. Thus, an increase in the permeable coverage under trees (50% and 100% increased coverage under existing trees) provided the best strategy for mitigating the impacts of urbanization by reducing the total, maximum, and average impervious flow by 3%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. Finally, an increase in permeable zones corresponding to plants was proposed via the implementation of green roofs. However, this strategy showed a response to the reduction in the lowest total flow at 1%.

TI Green roofs as a nature-based solution for improving urban
   sustainability: Progress and perspectives
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Green roofs are artificial ecosystems that provide a nature-based solution to environmental challenges such as climate change and the urban heat island. Green roofs aid in the conservation of both cooling and heating energy; deposition of particulates and mitigation of air pollution; control of runoff and water pollution; promotion of biodiversity; and provision of aesthetic and health benefits. This research is a holistic review of the green roof literature and provides a global perspective of the subject with a classification of modelling studies; and an extensive review of contributions to energy conservation, carbon sequestration, mitigation of air pollutants, runoff control; and urban noise reduction. The review covers the system's thermal performance modelling through several methodologies; experimental studies; parametric studies to assess the impact of various pa-rameters on the system's energy efficiency using several configuration parameters such as leaf area, foliage height and density, plant coverage, roof insulation, soil thickness, and irrigation; energy benefits; and envi-ronmental benefits including air pollutants mitigation, carbon sequestration, runoff control and urban noise reduction. Finally, review was complemented with a life cycle assessment study of green roofs, which examined the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing and construction, transportation, and disposal.Green roofs can reduce the cooling load by up to 70%, decrease the indoor temperature achieving an indoor air temperature reduction up to 15 degrees C, and provide a significant improvement of thermal comfort conditions. The environmental benefits of green roofs were focused on decreasing pollutants concentrations (e.g. PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2), sequestering carbon and reducing urban noise.

TI Vertical Green Structures to Establish Sustainable Built Environment: A
   Systematic Market Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Vertical Green Structures (VGS) emerged as a building skin Nature-based Solution (NbS) aside from green roofs. The motivation underlying this VGS exploitation is fast urbanisation and the need to limit both land consumption and vegetation loss. These structures can provide several ecosystem services like air purification, biodiversity enhancement, and noise reduction. Although the usage of VGS offers different versatile and multi-scalar benefits in the built environment, they still need to respond to all the requirements of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Over the last decades, technologies of VGS have been developed and new product types have become available in the market. This paper presents the overall development and benefits of VGS, and aims to provide a taxonomy by considering a systematic and interdisciplinary approach. The current market overview analyses and compares different aspects (i.e., environmental and economic features) of the products for a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art-from single component to system scale. The findings of this review lead to some suggestions to enhance the level of sustainability and increase the potential benefits. They look at both research and practice requirements to orient the users in selecting the most optimal VGS solution available in the market.

AB Extensive green roofs (EGRs) provide some important ecosystem services including the increase of urban biodiversity. Besides Sedum, the most used genus, the establishment of plant species with different functionality increases the habitats. A survey of spontaneous plant communities, adapted to drought and low nutrients, can be a valid tool of enrichment for this urban green feature. In 2014, we carried out an experiment on a roof, setting up 12 plots of 10 cm depth filled with three different substrates composed of compost, pelletised paper sludge, and tephra (Vulcaflor), as follows: VC (Vulcaflor + compost), VPC (Vulcaflor + pellet + compost) and VP (Vulcaflor + pellet). Annual and perennial forbs, annual and perennial legumes, geophytes, CAM and grasses were planted and seeded in the boxes. After five years, the plant community was dominated by CAM (Sedum) and geophytes, and then, to increase the biodiversity, we carried out a seeding of species, mainly belonging to the phytosociological classes Stellarietea mediae and Koelerio-Corynephoretea. We monitored the total canopy cover, plant diversity (Shannon, Evenness and Simpson indices) and the percentage of plant functional types from October 2019 to June 2020. The different nitrogen contents (VC>VPC>VP) affected the spread of CAM in VPC and VP, allowing the annual seeded species to colonise. The plant diversity increased especially in VP substrate. Phytosociological approach resulted suitable to select plant species able to establish in extreme climate conditions, as well as to coexist with CAM species, increasing the diversity in poor nutrient substrate.

TI Is the sustainability potential of vertical greening systems deeply
   rooted? Establishing uniform outlines for environmental impact
   assessment of VGS
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Building-related green infrastructures can help reduce several problems associated with urban life. However, while green roofs are reasonably well established and researched, questions remain about the environmental sustainability of vertical greening systems. This article reviews the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) to answer these questions. Methodological choices made in current LCA studies for modeling vertical greening systems are assessed. It is shown that a wide variety in boundary conditions used and assumptions made is prevalent. Based on the lessons learned a framework outline is proposed as a first step towards a more standardized assessment methodology. This outline is built around the life cycle phases and the boundary conditions of vertical greening systems, complemented by case specific data requirements and delivered benefits. The reviewed studies are compared with the framework to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement of current practices. It can be concluded that, to correctly represent the environmental impact of vertical greening systems, the associated benefits need to be better accounted for. For some benefits, i.e., energy savings due to reduced heating/cooling demand, CO2 sequestration, and air pollution reduction, it should be possible to implement them into LCA studies in the short to medium term because basic models and data are available for integration in the state-ofthe-art. For other benefits, such as impacts on biodiversity, noise reduction, and psychological and health effects, quantitative data are still lacking, and additional research should be carried out to enable their integration.

TI Microbial Composition and Functional Diversity Differ Across Urban Green
   Infrastructure Types
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Functional and biogeographical properties of soil microbial communities in urban ecosystems are poorly understood despite their role in metabolic processes underlying valuable ecosystem services. The worldwide emergence of engineered habitats in urban landscapes-green roofs, bioswales, and other types of soil-based green infrastructure-highlights the importance of understanding how environmental changes affect the community assembly processes that shape urban microbial diversity and function. In this study we investigated (1) whether engineered green roofs and bioswales in New York City had distinct microbial community composition and trait-associated diversity compared to non-engineered soils in parks and tree pits, and (2) if these patterns were consistent with divergent community assembly processes associated with engineered specifications of green infrastructure habitats not present in conventional, non-engineered green infrastructure; specifically, tree pit and park lawn soils. We found that green roofs and bioswales each had distinct bacterial and fungal communities, but that community composition and diversity were not significantly associated with geographic distance, suggesting that the processes structuring these differences are related to aspects of the habitats themselves. Bioswales, and to a lesser extent green roofs, also contained increased functional potential compared to conventional GI soils, based on the diversity and abundance of taxa associated with nitrogen cycling, biodegradation, decomposition, and traits positively associated with plant growth. We discuss these results in the context of community assembly theory, concluding that urban soil microbial community composition and diversity in engineered habitats are driven largely by environmental filtering, whereas stochastic processes are more important among non-engineered soils.

TI The Bryophyte Flora of Vienna
SO PLANTS-BASEL
AB The bryophyte flora of Vienna is documented only in parts. Old finds often appeared in publications about Lower Austria; only one study addressed the bryophytes of the inner city. Here, we present a bryophyte flora of Vienna, including historical reports and the results of recent investigations. From 1998 to 2023, we recorded 329 bryophyte taxa in Viennese urban territory. Fifty-six of these were liverworts, and 273 were mosses. Sixty-seven taxa are new for Vienna. Forty-nine taxa, given in historical studies, could no longer be found. If we also count these, 378 taxa occurred in Vienna to date. Of the current occurring bryophytes, 67 species have an endangerment classification. Rich in bryophytes were the dry grasslands of the Lobau, the oxbow lakes of the Lobau and the Prater, and large parts of the Wienerwald. But flat roofs and inner-city areas also showed more than 100 species. Compared to other European cities, Vienna is decidedly species-rich and highly responsible for some species in Austria. Reasons for this are the extensive green spaces and the pronounced climatic gradient from the sub-oceanic west to the sub-continental east of Vienna. Awareness raising for bryophytes we recommend in addition to the existing biotope protection.

TI Testing standard growth substrates for establishing native dry sandy
   grassland species on extensive green roofs in Northern Germany
SO BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB Green roofs are known to mitigate the negative effects of urban consolidation by offering diverse ecosystem functions compared to non-vegetated roofs. However, the support for native biodiversity might be improved by using native plant species. In a mesocosm experiment, we studied the suitability of three commercial green-roof growth substrates for the establishment of 27 native plant species from dry sandy grasslands of northwestern Germany over the course of four years. The substrates were mineral-based, but differed in the layering of organic matter. Total establishment rates reached 44 similar to 59% in Year 4, indicating the general suitability of the substrates. During the first weeks after seeding, with light irrigation, the vascular plant cover was greater in the similar substrates Zincolit (R) Plus (Z) and Zincolit (R) Plus-Leicht (ZL) with their compost-based organic mulch layers than in the substrate Sedumteppich (ST) with its organic matter evenly admixed with the mineral aggregates. In Years 2 and 3, however, the vascular plant cover was greater in the ST substrate, likely due to the better availability of water and nutrients from the organic matter compared to the dry surface-mulch layer variants Z and ZL. After severe drought events, the decline in plant cover was more pronounced in the ST substrate, likely representing a trade-off between lush growth and a susceptibility to drought. An indicator-species analysis revealed differences in species composition between the ST and Z/ZL substrates. Annual plant species were indicators of the ST substrate. Perennials, such as Thymus pulegioides and Achillea millefolium, were typical of the Z and ZL substrates. In addition to the general suitability of the tested standard substrates for target species establishment, the study indicated that a combination of different layers of substrate components resulted in different vegetation patterns that may have a positive effect on green-roof biodiversity.

TI Bee diversity on urban rooftop food gardens
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB Green infrastructure on rooftops in urban areas can enhance important ecosystem services. In addition to mitigating water runoff and regulating building temperatures, green roofs can provide food and nesting resources for wildlife. Rooftop gardens can also be utilized to cultivate food crops, giving them the potential to attenuate instances of food insecurity which are commonplace in many urban areas. Given that many crops depend on bee pollination, it is imperative to characterize the rooftop bee community. Therefore, we sampled three urban food roofs near downtown St. Louis, MO during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. We found 38 bee species utilizing the rooftop farms. We then compared the rooftop bee communities to those of two nearby ground-level community gardens. The roofs had lower abundances of Bombus species than the ground-level sites while non-native cavity nesters in the genus Megachile were overrepresented. These results indicate that the rooftop bee communities represent a nested subset of the species found at ground level. This has important implications for the management of green roofs for growing crops, as this shift in bee community structure may play a role in determining which crops can be adequately supported with pollination services.

TI Assessing financial subsidies for green roofs: A micro-scale analysis of
   Lisbon (Portugal)
SO CITIES
AB Green roofs (GR) provide ecological, economic, and socio-environmental benefits reducing the negative effects of urbanization and improving cities' resilience to tackle climate change. However, from the private investors' perspective, GR are economic unfeasible making necessary the development of public incentive policies. The study aims to assess adequate methodologies to design GR financial subsidies at the city scale, considering the influence of green roofs' ecosystem services (ES). The initial hypothesis is that constant financial subsidies are suboptimal, and it is necessary to develop more granular approaches. A cumulative and incremental 3-level costbenefit analysis (CBA) was performed at an urban micro-scale to allow the incorporation of environmental features in the monetary conversion of ES. Results confirm that positive ES provided by green roofs vary across the city. Consequently, constant values of financial subsidies at the city scale do not optimize public financial resources management, confirming the initial hypothesis. Moreover, findings reinforce the need to review the procedures for developing and granting public incentives at the municipal and/or macro-scale level for GR, especially as these solutions provide ES that are strongly influenced by environmental surrounding characteristics.

TI Urban Environmental Acupuncture for Improving the Sustainability of
   Dense City Areas - Polish Experiences from the SALUTE4CE Project
SO ARCHITECTURE CIVIL ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT
AB The idea of urban environmental acupuncture postulates, that in areas with no space available for green spaces, sustainability and climate resistance can be improved by small green spots in key locations. The project SALUTE4CE established pilot environmental acupuncture strategies in Central-European cities. The author was responsible for elaborating an Action Plan for the functional area of Chorzow, Ruda Slaska and Swietochlowice, Poland. The project aimed at finding spots with potential outcomes in terms of sustainability, reducing urban heat islands and improving comfort and quality of spaces, with nature based solutions: from planting climate resistant vegetation and restoring biodiversity, through improving local retention, to green roofs or vertical walls. The concept assumes, that acting in many small places can bring synergic effects and contribute to urban regeneration. Four pilot spots have been constructed so far, and other interventions shall be realized in the coming years. So far the project results have been disseminated in project documents and reports. This paper aims at a summary of project experiences and perspectives in regard to participating Polish cities.

TI Photovoltaic-green roof energy communities can uphold the European Green
   Deal: Probabilistic cost-benefit analyses help discern economically
   convenient scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The new roadmap of the European Union (EU), the European Green Deal, aims at tackling climate adaptation, energy, biodiversity, and pollution challenges. To contribute to such aim, the latest EU Renewable Energy Directive defines for the first time renewable energy communities. Among them, Photovoltaic-Green roof Energy Communities (PGECs) emerge as a potential option in urban areas. This paper investigates whether and under which conditions PGECs are capable to meet the objectives of the European Green Deal in an economically convenient manner. Since some conditions are context-specific, this research is showcased using a case study (Luxembourg). First, European legislation was reviewed to determine the suitable legal model for PGECs. Second, a systematic literature review helped identifying lifecycle costs and benefits of photovoltaic-green roofs and their value ranges. Third, a model for probabilistic social and private cost-benefit analyses was developed and tailored to Luxembourg. Lastly, Scenario Discovery was used to identify the ranges of input values leading to desirable net present values. Results show that PGECs can contribute to achieving multiple objectives of the European Green Deal in an economically convenient manner. From the societal perspective, PGECs are found to be economically convenient for any cost, benefit, and discount rate in the case study. From the private perspective, PGECs remain convenient in 62% of the scenarios, with green roofs' installation cost and electricity generation benefit playing pivotal roles. This paper presents a rare combination of probabilistic cost-benefit analyses and scenario discovery, It supports policymakers designing incentive schemes for PGECs, and can be replicated in other countries.

TI Bridging CBA and MCA for evaluating green infrastructure: Proposal of a
   new evaluation model (MAGICA)
SO SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES
AB The evaluation of green roofs and walls has been overlooking their real contribution to the built environment. This limits the application and development of these solutions, that have the potential to improve biodiversity, resilience, and carbon footprint of cities. In addition to the difficulty in measuring some ecosystem services, conventional cost-benefit analyses have proven to be inefficient as they cannot deal with non-monetized benefits. To overcome this gap, this study develops a comprehensive decision-making tool for assessing the value of green roofs and walls. The proposed methodology combines two well-known approaches -cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) -giving preference to the economic rationale for project investment optimi-zation. This new model - MAGICA (Modelling the Attractiveness of Green Infrastructure through a Combined Approach) - addresses differently monetary and non-monetary benefits for a more robust and complete consideration of all financial, economic, socio-environmental impacts of green infrastructure as well as the preferences of the investors and users. The methodology covers different scales of implementation, including new and existing built assets, and it can be easily adapted to other nature-based solutions. Despite determining an economic indicator, the model is best suited for making relative comparisons between different solutions and identifying which is most appropriate for a particular project context. A case study is applied to demonstrate the methodology, assessing 16 green roof systems for installation in a university building in Lisbon, Portugal. The analysis is based on the results of an experimental campaign and field surveys of students, professors, and staff.

TI Climate adaptive urban measures in Mediterranean areas: Thermal
   effectiveness of an advanced multilayer green roof installed in Palermo
   (Italy)
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Several nature based and climate adaptive solutions have been proposed to improve cities resilience to the effects of global warming and restore natural processes in strongly anthropized areas. Green roofs are among the most efficient nature based solutions to address recurrent urban challenges, such as pluvial floods and urban heat islands. Various benefits offered by green roofs are rather known, such as their capacity to enhance buildings thermal insulation; green roofs also favor urban biodiversity, improving buildings aesthetic value and human well being. Multilayer green roofs (MGRs) are green roofs with an additional layer that increases their water storage capacity. Deep analyses on MGRs are still lacking due to their recent development, and the few works in literature are prevalently focused on their stormwater retention primary function. This work explores the thermal function of an experimental MGR prototype installed in Palermo (Italy), comparing its response to local climate with that of an unaltered portion of the rooftop through the analysis of surface temperature time series collected over a two years monitoring period. Performances are evaluated thought various daily thermal indices, also analyzing the role of the water stored into the system. Results contribute to raise awareness about the benefits arising from the use of MGRs in semi-arid Mediterranean urban areas, confirming, as main thermal advantage, their cooling effect, with mean daily surface temperature reduced by 8.4% outdoor and 5.8% indoor; performances increases with water storage and are particularly evident during the hot and dry summers that typically characterize such regions.

TI More than weeds: Spontaneous vegetation in streets as a neglected
   element of urban biodiversity
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB Compared to green spaces, the ecological value of built elements has been largely ignored despite representing the main land cover in cities. In streets, pavements are linear built elements which are omnipresent in all neighborhood types and which extend over large cumulative areas in cities. We assessed the capacity of pavements to promote spontaneous flora and investigated the drivers of pavement plant assemblages. Based on a plant survey along 48 km of pavements in a French city which no longer uses pesticides, we examined the relative importance of multi-scale factors (i.e. landscape context, pavement characteristics and frequency of manual weeding) on different aspects of pavement plant communities including total plant cover, species richness and beta-diversity. More than 300 species were recorded. Plant assemblages were mainly determined by the pavement type, plant cover and species richness being much higher on sandy than on asphalt pavements. There were marked differences in species composition between pavement types with many more species associated with sandy than with asphalt pavements. We found a higher species richness and plant cover on pavements located in commercial and industrial areas than in residential neighborhoods. The effects of weeding frequency and the presence of green space around pavements were marginally important. We demonstrate that pavements with a high level of permeability play a major role in promoting urban biodiversity which should be taken into account by urban planners. We recommend that ecologists work with civil engineers and landscape architects to develop new urban ecological designs.

TI Assessing flooding and possible adaptation measures using remote sensing
   data and hydrological modeling in Sweden
SO CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Recently, Europe is experiencing more frequent and greater floods compared to the last 500 years due to climate change among other factors. This has increased the associated risks, especially in urban areas, which poses a great challenge to all stakeholders. To protect traffic networks from possible floods, this paper uses QGIS, remote sensing data, and HEC-HMS model to assess flooding events and possible adaptation measures. Two case studies have been taken; 1) a 60-mm rain-storm that occurred in 2012 on a main road in the Northern part of Sweden (NB)); and 2) a 35 -mm rainstorm that occurred in 2019 in the Southern part of Gothenburg (GO). The resulting flood hydrographs show that the peak reached are 0.5 m3/s and 3.8 m3/s in GO and NB, respectively. To adapt to these flood events, four adaptation measures were assessed namely afforestation, permeable pavements & green roofs, multi-use detention basins and culvert installation consid-ering food production, biodiversity, prosperity, and the environment. The study has shown that afforestation is an effective flood risk mitigation measure to handle both moderate and extreme rain events. Well-maintained permeable surfaces and green roofs are effective in reducing flooding due to moderate rainfall, but not in reducing the impacts of extreme rainfall events. Well-designed multi-functional detention basins are good flood protection measures, however, if they are not well-maintained, their efficiency may be reduced by up to 90 %. Culverts are effective for frequent and limited rain events, but extreme rain events may even increase flood risk and thereby contribute to damaging the infrastructure.

TI The Sustainable Prescription: Benefits of Green Roof Implementation for
   Urban Hospitals
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB If worldwide healthcare was a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet. The increase in global temperatures, combined with the negative impacts of urbanization, has made it more important than ever to introduce green spaces where possible. With climate change worsening, human health, both physically and mentally is on decline, making the effects of climate change especially pressing to the stability of healthcare systems. In order to mitigate the lasting impacts of climate change on healthcare facilities, a holistic solution is needed. Access to green space in hospitals has been shown to reduce emotional distress, improve mental health, increase socialization and community connection, increase physical activity, decrease cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, decrease pain management needs and hospital stay lengths and increase both patients' and staffs' overall satisfaction at the facility. Beyond benefiting those interacting with the hospital, green roofs have the ability to reduce the urban heat island effect, improve stormwater mitigation, increase biodiversity, and absorb toxins and pollutants through air filtration. Additionally, green roofs can offer lower maintenance costs and higher energy savings than traditional roofs, and improve patient satisfaction, which can result in future funding opportunities. However, the upfront and upkeep costs of installing a green roof can vary and must be considered before implementation. In this review, we explore the symbiotic relationship between urban green roofs and hospital/patient wellness through the lens of sustainability, which includes environmental, societal, and economic impacts. We review scientific journal articles investigating benefits of green space and green roofs and highlight examples of green roofs on hospitals in the United States; together, these approaches display the environmental, societal, and economic benefits of green roofs installed on healthcare facilities. This review offers insight to hospitals, decision makers, and government systems on the importance of green roofs in urban areas and how these infrastructures can support the economic growth of the institute. Using our framework, decision makers and planners for urban hospitals can evaluate how the addition of green roofs to their healthcare facilities can contribute to increased environmental resiliency, community health, and patient satisfaction.

TI Awareness and willingness to pay for green roofs in Mediterranean areas
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Green roofs have been extensively investigated in recent years, showing that their implementation in urban areas provides multiple benefits (e.g., pluvial flood mitigation, urban heat island reduction, energy saving, increase of biodiversity, CO2 sequestration) and supports sustainable urban development. Although green roof benefits have been widely recognized, the perception that the community has of these nature-based solutions and the willingness to pay for their installation in urban areas is still not clear nor quantified. Societal perception and willingness to pay for green roofs are fundamental for urban planners and decision makers, since they represent the community participation in the sustainable development of urban areas. In this work, we aim to analyze how citizens perceive green roofs and how willing they are to pay for the installation and maintenance of these nature-based solutions. We used an online survey to investigate the perception and the knowledge of green roofs as a potential solution to common environmental issues (i.e., urban flood, increase of temperature, energy consumption, air pollution and lack of green spaces), and the interest and willingness to pay for green roof installation on both public and private roofs. Based on the answers of 389 respondents living in Sardinia (Italy), our analysis revealed that most citizens are aware of what green roofs are, and they are aware that, although these nature-based solutions can not completely solve environmental issues, they can greatly contribute to the mitigation of these phenomena. Results also show a higher interest in the installation of green roofs on public buildings than on private ones, due to the high installation costs. Moreover, for private roofs, the possibility to install photovoltaic panels instead of GRs is generally preferred. Most of the respondents are willing to spend less than 100 euro per year for the maintenance of green roofs on public buildings and to invest less than 5000 euro for the installation on their own house.

TI GR2L: A robust dual-layer green roof water balance model to assess
   multifunctionality aspects under climate variability
SO FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
AB Urban blue-green infrastructures (BGIs) fulfill a variety of functions that enable cities to cope with climate change and additional urban anthropogenic pressures such as increasing population density, heat island effects, biodiversity loss, and progressive sealing of permeable surfaces. In the urban water cycle, BGIs can play an important role when it comes to both managing and mitigating the direct effects of ever-increasing periods of extended drought as well as the temporary excess of stormwater during and after heavy rainfall events. Although BGIs are multifunctional in principle, the individual infrastructure has to be designed and operated toward achieving a set of specific objectives, e.g., stormwater retention, infiltration, or storage for increased overall water resilience. In this study, we focus on green roofs as a key BGI for water resilient urban spaces. Green roofs have the advantage of unlocking underutilized roof space for urban water management and additional co-functions, avoiding additional urban land use conflicts at ground level. Green roofs are available in a multitude of design types based on the selection of vegetation, the make and thickness of the substrate layer, and the absence or presence of additional retention space. With GR2L, we present a robust dual-layer green roof water balance model that is able to cope with a variety of design aspects and was validated and calibrated using a data set of four green roof types with varying technical specifications and different vegetation cover. We used the calibrated models to assess how different green roof types operate under variable climatic conditions using meteo ensembles that consist of dry and wet years as well as a suite of randomly selected years. Calibration results indicate that a green roof factor (based on the classic crop factor) largely depending on the retention capacity of green roofs, makes the results widely applicable in planning. The results provide information on how green roof designs can be optimized for fulfilling a given set of water balance-driven multifunctionality objectives under varying climatic conditions and enabling an assessment of the performance of existing green roof designs against these conditions.

TI Vegetation on and around large-scale buildings positively influences
   native tropical bird abundance and bird species richness
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB High population growth in the tropics is driving urbanisation, removing diverse natural ecosystems. This is causing native species to suffer while introduced synanthropes flourish. City planners are developing urban greenspace networks, in part trying to address this issue. Architects contribute to these greenspace networks by designing elevated and ground level green spaces on large-scale buildings. However, little evidence is available on whether building green spaces support native fauna. This is true for birds in tropical Singapore that support important ecosystem services and have existence value. Therefore, in this study, we conducted bird surveys and statistical analyses to determine, if and how vegetation on three building green space types (ground gardens, roof gardens and green walls) have a positive impact on native or introduced bird species. We found that elevated greenery (roof gardens and green walls) on large-scale buildings supported a higher richness of birds and abundance of urban native birds than control roofs and walls without vegetation. Ground gardens supported similar levels of native species as roof gardens but also a larger proportion of generalist synanthropes. However, we found no tropical forest habitat specialists across any space type. Therefore, we recommend roof gardens and ground gardens as a potential space for urban natives outside of a less competitive ground-level urban environment. Our study also found certain building design elements (height of elevated space, presence of specific plants) supported different species groups. Therefore, we suggest that these ecological requirements for different species groups are considered when designing a building's green space.

TI A study on evaporative cooling capacity of a novel green wall to control
   ventilating air temperature
SO JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB Green buildings include structures that have passive indoor environmental control benefits, while green walls and roofs may offer extensive water holding capacity, reduced run out time, sound absorption, and fortified biodiversity in urban settings. Conventional green walls additionally provide passive cooling benefits via surface evaporation and plants' transpiration. In this study, a novel green wall comprised of bio-receptive porous concrete tiles was tested for its ability to act as an evaporative cooling pad. Ryegrass was grown on its surface, and air passed through the vegetated wall to determine its evaporative cooling effect. This novel green wall evaporative cooling pad (GWECP) showed a maximum cooling effectiveness of 0.97 with a maximum temperature reduction of  25.58 degrees C with 50 degrees C inlet air temperature. The effect of vegetation layer height was further examined, where a grass layer 30 cm in height showed a maximum cooling rate of  9.57 & PLUSMN; 0.79 kW, and a grass layer 22.5 cm in height showed a maximum evaporation rate of 3.36 & PLUSMN; 0.08 g s  1 when challenged with different inlet air conditions ranging from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C. As a novel evaporative cooling system, the GWECP had maximum cooling and evaporation coefficients of 10.7 kW m  2 C  1 and 1.18 g s  1, respectively. This data set suggests a prospective application for this GWECP as an energy-efficient cooling system for ventilated air by providing carbon-free indoor air-cooling for any extremely warm outdoor weather conditions with the other associated benefits of green walls.

TI Experimental analysis on heat mitigation potential of stacked coir fiber
   mat and perlite as an alternative for green roof
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES
AB Depleting non-renewable resources and global warming motivated researchers to focus on passive cooling solutions to minimize the internal temperature of buildings. The benefits of using stacked coir mat and perlite in wet and dry conditions are tested for their cooling capacity compared to green roofs are explored in this research work. The benefits are quantified in terms of heat flow and temperature variations in a field experiment, and they are compared to a conventional bare roof in a tropical region in the Indian subcontinent (8.9142(o)N, 76.632(o)E). The heat transfer to the inside of the roof for dry coir mat paved, stacked coir mat and perlite bed, stacked wet coir mat and wet perlite bed, and extensive green roof system with coir mat as retaining layer are reduced by 38.43%, 63.21%, 55.3% and 56.97% respectively. This study evaluated the evaporative cooling capacity of wet coir mat and wet perlite, which have given almost near cooling capacity of green roof for 24 h. Considering its low maintenance and low initial cost, the usage of the stacked coir fibre mat with perlite shows a compatible reduction in heat transfer through the roof slab as that of the green roof. The coir insulation with perlite will undoubtedly reduce the energy requirement for heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to a greater extent.

TI Comparing PV-green and PV-cool roofs to diverse rooftop options using
   decision analysis
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Flat roofs can employ a range of technologies to improve sustainability, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, green roofs, cool roofs, or a combination of these options. Yet, weighing the benefits, costs, and performance of different roofing technologies is complex, especially when different stakeholders are involved. Decision analysis techniques, such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), can be used to systematically evaluate a diverse range of rooftop options to assess trade-offs in a quantitative way and avoid decision biases. This study offers a holistic comparison of different roof types, considering stakeholder preferences and uncertainty using MCDA. Ten flat roof options are compared, including black, gravel, cool, extensive green and semi-intensive green roofs, each with or without a rooftop PV installation, for nine objectives and three hypothetical stakeholder profiles. Performance is evaluated using building energy simulation, hydrologic modeling, and literature research. Uncertainty analyses are used to evaluate the effects of model assumptions on the MCDA results. For assumed preferences of an urban planner and environmentalist, semi-intensive green roofs with integrated PV installation are the best performing option; however, for a hypothetical building owner more concerned with costs, a gravel roof with PV ranks best. Uncertainty plays a role in the results, in particular, the uncertainty of the predicted outcome of options for the building owner, which can change the top-ranking options considerably. The uncertainty analyses are useful to identify consensus options over all three stakeholder types. Despite considerable uncertainty, extensive and semi-intensive green roofs with PV are recommended as relatively robust bestperforming options.

TI Zoysia Soil-Less Green Roof's Performance: A Life Cycle Assessment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES
AB The use of green roofs is demonstrated to improve the energy performance of buildings, increase biodiversity, reduce environmental impacts of urban areas, and mitigate climate change phenomena. Their use on a large scale is desirable in the coming years. Still, the choice of the most suitable green roof design solution should also consider the impacts of their production. Within this study, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used to evaluate the environmental impact of a particular typology of soil-less green roofs ideated by an Italian company. In this lightweight green roof, the growing medium is replaced by recycled felt layers, filtration is guaranteed by geotextile, and a closed-loop sub-irrigation system fertilises the pre-growth lawn placed on the top. The extremely low weight of this system suggests an optimal use in building retrofitting scenarios, but its environmental implication was not known. The environmental impact of this product has been assessed with an attributional cradle-to-gate approach through four different methodologies (ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint H V1.1, Ecological footprint V1.01, and IPCC 2013 GWP 100y V1.0) using the ecoinvent v3, Agri-footprint 1.0, and ELCD database on the SimaPro 8.4.4.0 software. The IPCC method has shown a Global Warming Potential of 7.66 kg of CO2 eq. for 1 m(2) of Pratotetto (R) green roof; however, the reuse of waste materials from the textile industry must be considered.

TI Optimization of Roof Coverage and Tank Size for Integrated Green Roof
   Rainwater Harvesting Systems-a Case Study
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are effective in alleviating water supply shortages, while green roofs (GRs) can contribute to stormwater management, air quality improvement, thermal regulation of buildings, and biodiversity support. Despite their individual benefits, both systems are not frequently combined. This paper investigates the potential for integrating these systems through a hydrologic modeling and optimization approach, using a case study in Paris, France. The study utilized a Conceptual Interflow model (CI-model) coupled with a Water Balance (WB) model to describe the rainfall-runoff relationship of integrated green roof and rainwater harvesting (GR-RWH) systems. An NSGA-II optimization was then applied to the CI-WB model to determine the optimal tank sizing of GR-RWH systems for meeting different water demands. The results show that GR-RWH systems have water reliability (WR) values similar to those of traditional RWH systems without GR, albeit with larger tank volumes. For new buildings in Paris, a GR-RWH system with approximately 25 to 75% GR coverage meets rainwater utilization needs with low investment while also providing the added benefits of GRs.

AB Green roof technology has been established through research and in-situ monitoring to provide good potential for stormwater retention, mitigation of urban heat island (UHI) effect, reduction of local air pollution, increase local biodiversity and most importantly, passive energy savings both for new buildings and as a retrofit option for older buildings. However, even with this existing wide range of benefits, green roof technology research and markets in terms of implementation and widescale commercial adoption is relatively non-existent in temperate climates of the world such as the UK, compared to other regions with different prevailing climatic characteristics. This research investigates the causative factors and barriers for this relatively slow rate of adoption both from technological and economic perspectives with the United Kingdom as a case study. A number of experimental papers on energy savings benefits from green roofs were compiled; and from the analysis of collated data, it was found that green roofs tend to perform better from an energy savings perspective in hotter climates of the world or during the summer season in colder climates when temperatures are higher such as seasonal heatwaves. Further research into the energy savings behaviour during winter in temperate regions is required to assert the all-season suitability of green roofs for implementation in new builds within the United Kingdom. Government legislation and incentives could potentially increase wide-scale adoption. The performance of green roofs is however found to be largely climate dependent, meaning the performance varies across different regions of the world, therefore increased local research and quantification into metrics will lead to better understanding and potential adoption of green roofs and how to best optimise their design according to the region in which they are to be installed.

TI Green Water from Green Roofs-The Ecological and Economic Effects
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green roofs (GRs) have been one of the most popular solutions for water harvesting in urban areas. Apart from their water retention role and increasing biodiversity, they constitute the missing link between the built and the natural environment, which is required for sustainable human living in cities. This paper aims to calculate the ecological (EE) and economic effect (EcE) of water harvesting via GRs, by contrasting with a traditional roof, and to perform an economic analysis of the social cost benefits that GRs generate during their life cycle, using the Net Present Value (NPV) method. All the calculations and analyses were conducted for both intensive and extensive GRs in 11 of the largest municipalities in Poland, with a population of >250,000 inhabitants. According to the results of this study, water retention and the economic and ecological effects of GRs are highest in the municipalities with the highest assumed number of GRs (Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, and Szczecin). The average EE and EcE equals 507,000 m(3)/yr and 621,000 USD/yr. The NPV results show that the effectiveness of investments in intensive GRs is, to a certain extent, more significant than in extensive GRs and the average equals 60.77 and 4.47 USD/yr for intensive and extensive GRs, respectively. The results could serve as a reference for the evaluation and optimization of the energy efficiency of rainwater harvesting schemes, in European cities.

TI Residents' Living Environments, Self-Rated Health Status and Perceptions
   of Urban Green Space Benefits
SO FORESTS
AB Urban green space (UGS) could contribute to sustainable urban development. Studying residents' perception of UGS ecological benefits could provide the empirical basis to improve UGS management and quality of life. Based on the questionnaire surveys of 432 residents in Beijing, assisted by non-parametric statistical tests, this paper assessed the relationships between residents' living environments and self-rated health status and their impacts on residents' perceptions of UGS ecological benefits. We paid attention to residents' perceptions of UGS's notable thermal environmental benefits under the climate-change backdrop. The results showed that: (1) Residents were inclined to perceive direct UGS ecological benefits better than the indirect types; (2) Residents growing up in the city had better self-rated health status than those growing up in the suburb and the village; and residents growing up in the suburb had a better understanding of the cooling benefits of green walls; (3) Residents currently dwelling in the city had a better understanding of UGS benefits, including shading, cooling by green roofs, mitigating the heat island effect and enhancing urban biodiversity, than those dwelling in the village; and (4) Residents with "very good" self-rated health status had a significantly better understanding of UGS benefits regarding shading, providing varied colors and habitats, storing carbon, purifying air, and collecting rainwater.

TI Up on the roof and down in the dirt: Differences in substrate properties
   (SOM, potassium, phosphorus and pH) and their relationships to each
   other between sedum and wildflower green roofs
SO PLOS ONE
AB In urban areas green roofs provide important environmental advantages in regard to biodiversity, storm water runoff, pollution mitigation and the reduction of the urban heat island effect. There is a paucity of literature comparing different types of green roof substrates and their contributions to ecosystem services or their negative effects. This study investigated if there was a difference between sedum and wildflower green roof substrate properties (soil organic matter (SOM), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and pH values) of 12 green roofs in the city of Brighton & Hove. One hundred substrate samples were collected (50 from sedum roof substrates and 50 from wildflower roof substrates) and substrate properties were investigated using standard protocols. Comparisons were made between substrate characteristics on both types of roof substrate with a series of multiple linear regressions. Sedum roofs displayed significantly higher values of SOM, P and pH. There were significant positive relationships between SOM and K concentrations, SOM and P concentrations, pH and K concentrations and pH and P concentrations on sedum roofs. This study concluded that sedum roof substrates are more favourable for plant water use efficiency and also contained a significantly higher percentage of SOM than wildflower roofs. However, higher concentrations of P in sedum roof substrates may have implications in regard to leachates.

TI Stress-gradient framework for green roofs: Applications for urban
   agriculture and other ecosystem services
SO ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
AB Green roofs are promoted to contribute to more resilient cities by enhancing urban ecosystem services and food systems. Extensive, low-maintenance green roofs experience frequent environmental stresses, which reduce plant survival and growth. Stress-tolerant plants are therefore used to sustain well-established services, such as building temperature regulation. However, transitioning extensive green roofs to provide other key urban services, such as food production, involves less tolerant plant species. Although facilitation exerted by stress-tolerant species (nurses) has been proposed to improve the performance of stress-intolerant species (proteges) in extensive green roofs, the conditions under which facilitation could occur are not well understood. Therefore, a comprehensive framework is needed that integrates current knowledge on how the performance of protege species is affected by nurse plants across stress conditions.We present a framework for green roof research that results in a linear model that integrates (i) modern trait-environment theory and (ii) facilitation ecology in a refined stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) originally developed following study of other stressful environments.The model makes testable predictions on how phenotypic traits mediate the performance response of protege species to nurse plants along stress gradients in extensive green roofs. This is not only useful for the analysis of eco-physiological performance measures directly linked with multifunctionality and ecosystem services, but also demographic or 'vital' rates that drive species persistence and plant community maintenance.We discuss a range of applications related to key agricultural and ecological questions arising from contemporary extensive green roof research, such as enhancing conditions for crop production, weed management, plant invasions and biodiversity conservation. We also provide guidelines for the generation of appropriate data and for fitting this model using readily available statistical procedures.Our framework will allow researchers to assess under which environmental conditions nurse-protege interactions are feasible. We expect the findings from such research to help develop strategies and guidelines for managing environmental conditions that optimize protege performances that ultimately affect the delivery of ecosystem services in constructed urban green spaces.

TI Mediterranean Extensive Green Roof Self-Sustainability Mediated by
   Substrate Composition and Plant Strategy
SO HORTICULTURAE
AB In the cultivation of extensive green roofs (EGRs), substrate composition is a key aspect together with the evaluation of suitable recycled materials. Recycling materials as amendments can improve the establishment of a self-sustainable EGR, thus providing ecosystem services and benefits from a circular economy and climate change perspective. This study investigates the effects of compost and paper sludge on water retention, substrate temperature attenuation and plant diversity in an EGR experiment. The substrates were composed of tephra (V), compost (C) and paper sludge (P) as follows: VC, as control, VPC and VP. Herbaceous species with different ecological functionality (succulents, annuals, perennials, legumes, geophytes) were sown and/or transplanted with no cultivation inputs. Plant community composition -abundance- and diversity-richness-, substrate water retention and temperature were analyzed. The VPC and VC had the same average substrate temperature, with values lower than VP. The water retention capacity was higher in VC, thanks to the presence of compost. The substrate with paper sludge (VPC and VP) showed the highest species diversity. The VPC substrate was the best compromise for EGR temperature mitigation and plant diversity improvement. Plant functional types in EGRs can be increased, and thus the biodiversity, by modulating the quality and percentage of amendments. The substrate composition can also affect water retention and substrate temperature. In addition, the use of recycling paper sludge in growing media is a winning strategy to reduce waste.

TI Germination Performances of 14 Wildflowers Screened for Shaping Urban
   Landscapes in Mountain Areas
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Despite the high biodiversity in the Mediterranean region, the use of wildflowers from mountain areas in urban landscaping projects is hampered by the limited information on their seed germination performances. This research evaluated germination traits of 14 native herbaceous wildflower species from northern west Italian alpine and subalpine areas. Seed germination in Petri dishes at 25 degrees C was performed, applying two different photoperiod conditions (light/dark at 0/24 h or 12/12 h). A high rate and rapid germination are key features for seed and seedling nursery production; thus, the main germination indices were evaluated: the final germination percentage, the index of germination relative to light, the time of first germination, the time to reach 50% of germinated seeds, the germination period, and the mean germination time. Overall, Bellis perennis L., Leucanthemum vulgare Lam., and Taraxacum officinale Weber, from mesophilic mountainous hilly grasslands, and Dianthus carthusianorum L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill. from higher altitudes, turned out to be interesting. Particular attention could be paid to D. carthusianorum for germination synchrony in both growth conditions, high speed, and short germination period (8.5 and 16.2 days in the dark and in the light, respectively).

TI Analysis of biodiversity attributes for extensive vegetated roofs in a
   semiarid region of central Argentina
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Vegetated roofs (VRs) contribute to the resilience of cities by providing multiple ecosystem functions. A wide range of these benefits depends on the plant layer. Here, we hypothesized that increasing biodiversity attributes (i.e., composition, structural, and functional) in VRs will improve their performance under the climate conditions of semiarid regions. We aimed to (i) characterize functional groups of eight species assessed from key functional traits, (ii) evaluate species performance through survival and coverage, comparing biodiversity attributes from mono to polyculture treatments, (iii) analyze the relationship between performance with biodiversity attributes, and (iv) systematize and rank the treatments using an index to select those with the best performance and to recommend them for VRs in semiarid regions. We expect those treatments with higher biodiversity attributes will show better performances than simpler ones. Functional traits as indicators of ecosystem functions of eight species and four life-forms (succulents: Sedum acre, S. lineare, S. reflexum, creeping herbs: Phyla nodiflora, Glandularia x hybrida, tall forb: Grindelia cabrerae, and grasses: Eustachys distichophylla, and Nassella tenuissima) were evaluated through a trial using 22 microcosms during a 12-month experimental study. A principal component analysis and a cluster analysis were used to detect functional groups according to leaf and plant height traits. We used the Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess species survival among the treatments. Final coverage and growth increment (and their coefficients of variation) were used to construct the performance index. The PCA and CA determined five functional groups: I) succulents; II) creeping herbs; III) N. tenuissima; IV) E. distichophylla, and V) G. cabrerae. Four species showed significantly differences in survival rates among the treatments (p < 0.05), and six treatments were characterized as the best ones: with the highest coverage (>93%) and growth increment (81%), and with low CVs. Although some monoculture (Sedum spp., P. nodiflora and, E. distichophylla) reached comparable index values with respect to mixed microcosms, for VRs we recommend those plant mixtures combining biodiversity attributes because they provide both more ecosystem services and higher chances of survival and phenological complementarity in the long term.

TI Wetland Roofs as an Attractive Option for Decentralized Water Management
   and Air Conditioning Enhancement in Growing Cities-A Review
SO WATER
AB While constructed wetlands have become established for the decentralized treatment of wastewater and rainwater, wetland roofs have only been built in isolated cases up to now. The historical development of wetland roofs is described here on the basis of a survey of literature and patents, and the increasing interest in this ecotechnology around the world is presented. In particular, this article describes the potential for using wetland roofs and examines experience with applications in decentralized water management in urban environments and for climate regulation in buildings. Wetland roofs are suitable as a green-blue technology for the future-particularly in cities with an acute shortage of unoccupied ground-level sites-for the decentralized treatment of wastewater streams of various origins. Positive "side effects" such as nearly complete stormwater retention and the improvement of climates in buildings and their surroundings, coupled with an increase in biodiversity, make wetland roofs an ideal multi-functional technology for urban areas.

TI Pollinator-Mediated Gene Flow Connects Green Roof Populations Across the
   Urban Matrix: A Paternity Analysis of the Self-Compatible Forb
   <i>Penstemon</i> <i>hirsutus</i>
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Gene flow between populations can help maintain genetic diversity and prevent inbreeding, which is especially important for small, fragmented habitats. Many plant species rely on pollinators to move pollen between populations. In urban areas, insufficient pollinator services may result in limited gene flow, which can have negative consequences such as genetic drift and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, restored populations that are established with few founders of low genetic diversity may have limited long-term population persistence. Here, we tested the hypotheses that populations of a self-compatible forb established on urban green roofs from nursery stock are genetically depauperate and that limited gene (pollen) flow between populations will result in increased inbreeding. We compared the neutral genetic diversity of Penstemon hirsutus, using nine microsatellite loci, between three green roof populations established from nursery stock and three natural populations. We also established ten experimental populations on green roofs and measured rates of outcrossing and inbreeding and identified the movement of pollen within and between roofs using a paternity analysis. We found that neutral genetic diversity of populations established from nursery stock was lower than that of natural populations, although the level of inbreeding was also lower on the green roofs. In our experimental populations, we found that the rates of outcrossing and inbreeding varied between the roof populations. Our results suggest that inbreeding may be correlated with cover of co-flowering species but not with any of the other measured site properties. The location of likely pollen donors suggested that on average, 75% of pollen was derived from plants within the population (including self) and 25% came from plants on different roofs. Our results document realized pollen movement within and between green roofs, demonstrating that these habitats provide important connectivity in a fragmented environment.

TI GREEN ROOF PLANT RESPONSES TO GREYWATER IRRIGATION
SO APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Water is an essential natural resource and is even known to be the cause of many wars of history. While people depend on it to survive, they also use it for everyday activities and several other purposes. As for plants, water is an essential factor, one they need for growth. Although irrigation is really important for certain agricultural plants, many criticise its water consumption especially on scientific platforms and media. This naturally pushes the world to find alternative ways to decrease the water consumption where possible. Greywater (GW) use is one of these alternative ways. This study aims to focus on two different but ecologically useful recent phenomena; GW use and green roofs. GW use makes it possible to decrease water consumption by replacing irrigation water, while green roofs (GRs) are known to increase biodiversity in urban areas and to decrease heat island effect and as a result reduce the costs of air conditioning. Since the main purposes of this study are to evaluate the use of GW on GRs to examine if there might be an ecologically and economically more beneficial way to keep the roof green, we used a prepared greywater simulation (PGWS) to measure green roof plants' responses to it. Two different greywater models, non-diluted prepared greywater simulation (N-D.PGSW) and 50% diluted prepared greywater simulation (%50-D.PGWS), were used for irrigation; while tap water (TW) irrigation and no irrigation (N-I) were the other two conditions to make the study more reliable.

TI An open-source automatic survey of green roofs in London using
   segmentation of aerial imagery
SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
AB Green roofs can mitigate heat, increase biodiversity, and attenuate storm water, giving some of the benefits of natural vegetation in an urban context where ground space is scarce. To guide the design of more sustainable and climate-resilient buildings and neighbourhoods, there is a need to assess the existing status of green roof coverage and explore the potential for future implementation. Therefore, accurate information on the prevalence and characteristics of existing green roofs is needed, but this information is currently lacking. Segmentation algorithms have been used widely to identify buildings and land cover in aerial imagery. Using a machine learning algorithm based on U-Net to segment aerial imagery, we surveyed the area and coverage of green roofs in London, producing a geospatial dataset (, ). We estimate that there was 0.23 km(2) of green roof in the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) of London, 1.07 km(2) in Inner London, and 1.89 km(2) in Greater London in the year 2021. This corresponds to 2.0 % of the total building footprint area in the CAZ and 1.3 % in Inner London. There is a relatively higher concentration of green roofs in the City of London, covering 3.9 % of the total building footprint area. Test set accuracy was 0.99, with an F score of 0.58. When tested against imagery and labels from a different year (2019), the model performed just as well as a model trained on the imagery and labels from that year, showing that the model generalised well between different imagery. We improve on previous studies by including more negative examples in the training data and by requiring coincidence between vector building footprints and green roof patches. We experimented with different data augmentation methods and found a small improvement in performance when applying random elastic deformations, colour shifts, gamma adjustments, and rotations to the imagery. The survey covers 1558 km2 of Greater London, making this the largest open automatic survey of green roofs in any city. The geospatial dataset is at the single-building level, providing a higher level of detail over the larger area compared to what was already available. This dataset will enable future work exploring the potential of green roofs in London and on urban climate modelling.

TI Evaluating and comparing the green wall retrofit suitability across
   major Australian cities
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Urban densification continues to present a unique set of economic and environmental challenges. A growing shortage of green space and infrastructure is intrinsically linked with urban growth and development. With this comes the loss of ecosystem services such as urban heat island effects, reduction of air quality and biodiversity loss. Vertical greenery systems (VGS) offer an adaptive solution to space-constrained areas that are characteristic of dense urban areas, and can potentially improve the sustainability of cities. However, in order to promote VGS uptake, methods are required to enable systematic appraisal of whether existing walls can be retrofitted with VGS. Further, feasibility studies that quantify the potential for retrofit suitability of VGS across entire urban areas are lacking. This study established an evaluation tool for green wall constructability in urban areas and validated the assessment tool by determining the quantity of walls in five major Australian cities that could potentially have VGS incorporated into the existing infrastructure. Each wall was analysed using an exclusionary set of criteria that evaluated and ranked a wall based on its suitability to VGS implementation. Sydney and Brisbane recorded the greatest proportional length of walls suitable for VGS, with 33.74% and 34.12% respectively. Conversely, Perth's urban centre was the least feasible site in which to incorporate VGS, with over 97% of surveyed walls excluded, mainly due to the prevalence of <1 m high fence lines and glazed shopfronts. This study aimed to evaluate feasibility assessments of green wall retrofitability in highly urbanised areas with the intention of creating an analytical method that is accessible to all. This method, coupled with the promising number of feasible walls found in this study, emphasises the need for more government policy and incentives encouraging green wall uptake and could play a pivotal role in the expansion of green infrastructure and urban forestry.

TI Response of Spontaneous Plant Communities to <i>Sedum mexicanum</i>
   Cover and Water Availability in Green Roof Microcosms
SO LAND
AB Lack of maintenance can lead to 'weedy' spontaneous vegetation on green roofs. Aspects of green roof design, including substrate depth and roof height, have been shown to influence the composition of spontaneous vegetation. In drier climates, Sedum species are often planted on shallow substrate 'extensive' green roofs and irrigated during summer to maintain cover. However, the response of spontaneous vegetation to Sedum cover and water availability is unclear. Understanding this relationship could help minimise maintenance and maintain Sedum vegetation cover. We hypothesised that increasing Sedum (Sedum mexicanum) cover and reduced water availability would reduce the abundance, biomass, species and functional richness, and the community weighted mean specific leaf area (SLA; CWM by abundance) of spontaneous plant communities. We conducted a 10-month experiment in green roof microcosms planted with S. mexicanum (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% total cover), subjected to a well-watered or water-deficit irrigation treatment, and sown with a mix of 14 plant species that commonly occur as spontaneous on green roofs. We measured spontaneous species abundance, community biomass, and functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and relative growth rate), and calculated species and functional richness. Increasing S. mexicanum cover reduced spontaneous species abundance and species and functional richness but did not affect community biomass. Species richness was affected by the interaction of S. mexicanum cover and watering treatment and was greatest in well-watered microcosms with 0% S. mexicanum cover. Increased water availability increased spontaneous plant biomass but did not affect functional richness. The SLA of spontaneous communities was affected by the interaction of S. mexicanum cover and watering and was significantly greater in well-watered treatments where S. mexicanum cover was <100%. Therefore, maximising Sedum cover and limiting water availability on green roofs will likely limit the abundance, biomass, and diversity of spontaneous vegetation. Conversely, for green roofs where substrate is left to be naturally colonised, increasing water availability could encourage establishment and increase functional richness of spontaneous vegetation.

TI AMF inoculation of green roof substrate improves plant performance but
   reduces drought resistance of native dry grassland species
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Standard extensive green roofs (EGRs) with their shallow substrate layers represent extreme sites for plant growth and therefore are planted mostly with drought-resistant species, including non-native plant species. As standard EGR substrates often lack potentially mutualistic soil microorganisms, it has been stated that inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) might increase plant performance and drought resistance. Aiming to support native biodiversity on EGRs, we tested whether AMF inoculation into standard green roof substrate can enhance plant performance and drought resistance of regionally occurring native dry grassland species.
   The results of a pot experiment with 11 native plant species growing with and without AMF inoculation showed considerable differences in fitness-relevant plant traits. Over 88 days of moderate drought conditions, inoculated plants produced 2.5 times more above-ground biomass than control plants. In addition, the number of inflorescences on inoculated plants was significantly higher in 5 out of 7 flowering species. Under severe drought stress created by stopping the water supply, however, inoculated plants wilted on average 2.38 days earlier than control plants.
   Although the underlying mechanisms of the observed results remain unresolved, AMF inoculation might help to enhance an earlier and higher seed set, facilitating the establishment of a soil seed bank, which is necessary for a self-sustaining plant population in drought-governed habitats such as EGRs.

TI Evaluating the Ecological Services of Roof Greening Plants in Beijing
   Based on Functional Traits
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Selecting suitable species to enhance ecological functions is crucial for improvements in the planning and design of roof greening and in maintaining sustainable urban development, especially in rapidly urbanized areas. Assisted by field trips to enhance studies, the present project assessed the ecological functions of 207 plant species used for roof greening in Beijing based on their key functional traits. The results indicate that regulating, cultural, supplying, and supporting functions differed significantly among species and families in the study area. Rosaceae species have higher levels of overall ecological functions than other species, and a large number of Compositae species have lower-level functions. Compared to other families, Araliaceae and Nyctaginaceae have higher mean values of cultural and supporting functions and the highest mean overall function value of 37. Ulmaceae, Sapindaceae, Ginkgoaceae, Berberidaceae, and Aceraceae have higher mean regulating, cultural, supporting, and overall function values. Amaranthaceae, Umbelliferae, Lamiaceae, Saxifragaceae, Ericaceae, and Gramineae have lower values. The existing roof greening in Beijing includes some pitfalls with respect to plant composition as well as plant selection that does not consider ecological functions. The following measures could be proposed to increase ecological functions: (1) Increasing the number of plants with shallow roots and with strong adaptation traits to roof conditions; (2) Enriching ecological communities with diverse plants with high ecological functions; and (3) Carrying out rational ecological planning and management based on detailed and objective data on plant species. Future studies should focus on specifying plant functional traits to enhance ecological functions.

TI Plant-pollinator interactions on green roofs are mediated by substrate
   characteristics and plant community composition
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Green roofs can support pollinator communities in cities. However, little is known about the influence of green roof characteristics such as substrate and vegetation type on the abundance and diversity of attracted pollinators. Here we aimed to assess how green roof design impacts their attractiveness to pollinators. Using mesocosms on a rooftop in Paris (France), we studied the impact of two substrate types, two substrate depths (10 and 30 cm) and either monocultures or mixtures of 5 plant species on plant pollinator interactions. In the case of mixtures, we also tested the effect of substrate type (natural soil vs. artificial substrate). We counted the number of floral units and recorded the visits by pollinators once a week from mid-June to mid-August. The pollinator assemblage visiting plant communities included 4 functional groups of pollinators: domesticated honey bees, bumble bees, solitary bees and syrphid flies. Effects of treatments on pollinator community composition were variable and plant species dependent. Deep monoculture treatments resulted in the highest number of floral units and visits. Although plants grown on natural soil had less floral units than on artificial substrate, both treatments resulted in a similar number of visits. This paper provides evidence that plant-pollinator interactions on green roofs are modulated by substrate type, substrate depth and plant community. We suggest that combining plant species with diverse flowering morphologies and phenologies can enhance pollinator diversity. When possible, increasing substrate depth can result in higher levels of attractiveness.

TI Friends with benefits: The effects of vegetative shading on plant
   survival in a green roof environment
SO PLOS ONE
AB Green roofs help ameliorate some of the adverse social, economic and environmental effects of urbanisation. However, green roofs are harsh environments for plants, as they must cope with shallow soils, low nutrient availability, high solar radiation, low water availability and high pollution/disturbances. The effect of shade plants on vegetation survivability was investigated using green roof mesocosms with four different native species pairs (shade plant and a target ground cover plant). To examine the effect of shading and competition on plant growth and survival, plant pairs were subjected to four treatments; naturally shaded with a shade plant shading the target plant, artificially shaded with an artificial plant shading the target plant, unshaded natural which had a trimmed shade plant providing no shade to the target plant and an unshaded treatment with the target plant being the sole occupant of the mesocosm. The experiment ran for 11 months with measurements taken monthly to record growth and visual health of the target plant. Soil moisture and biomass data was collected at the end of the experiment. Overall, natural shade treated plants had the highest biomass while unshaded plants had the lowest biomass. Contrary to our predictions, the shaded artificial and the unshaded natural had similar moderate biomass. This similarity suggests that while shading had a positive influence on plant growth, there was also a positive influence of growing with a shade plant which is not accounted for by shading. The results highlight the complexity of biotic relations between plants and emphasises that the presence of a nurse plants can be benefit to the survival and growth of other species within a green roof ecosystem.

TI Extensive roof greening with native sandy dry grassland species: Effects
   of different greening methods on vegetation development over four years
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Extensive green roofs (EGRs) offer several beneficial ecosystem services for sustainable urban development. However, most standard green roofs have been designed with species-poor plant mixtures containing non-native species. Aiming to increase the nature conservation values of EGRs, we developed and tested a vascular plant seed mixture including regionally occurring native sandy dry grassland species in experimental miniature roofs in Northwestern Germany (temperate oceanic climate) over 4 years. We tested the mixture at two seed densities (1 and 2 g/m(2)). Additionally, we tested seeding at 1 g/m(2) and introducing raked plant material collected from an ancient dry grassland. The total establishment rates of sown species reached 92-96% in the first year, but dropped to 40-60% in the last 2 years, with the highest values for the plots with raked material. Twenty-four additional species (11 vascular, 7 lichen, and 6 moss species, including 7 red-list species) typical of sandy dry grasslands were introduced through the raked material. Vascular plants reached 60-70% cover in the second year. Severe drought periods in the third and the fourth year led to a strong decline of vascular plant cover then. As this cover was higher in the plots with raked material, we assume facilitative effects through the well-developed cryptogam layer containing a mix of pleurocarpous and acrocarpous mosses and lichens. Spontaneously establishing acrocarpous mosses in sown plots did not seem to provide this same function. We conclude that EGRs designed with regionally occurring sandy dry grassland plant species and especially the application of raked plant material from ancient grassland is a fruitful approach to increase the value of green roofs for native phytodiversity.

TI Where species don't meet: Invisibilized animals, urban nature and city
   limits
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE
AB A growing body of literature is concerned with 'healing' our cities, fostering an ethic of care for urban nature and creating more socially and environmentally just cities. At the same time, urban biodiversity is the focus of an increasing number of projects at multiple scales. However, in contrast to the ethos of multispecies 'entanglement' and 'becoming with' that typically animates this research, large numbers of animals 'entangled' in the machinations of our cities constitute a 'nature' that remains mostly unseen. And yet, it is the local and global practices these animals are part of - associated with food, entertainment, education, companionship and research - and the persistent relations of use and exploitation that underpin them, that are most directly implicated in the ongoing environmental degradation, destruction of habitats and extinction of species that create the 'problem' of urban biodiversity. We therefore argue that a persistent anthropocentrism is hampering efforts to respond effectively to the findings and recommendations of the IPCC, IPBES, FAO and others. Based on a thorough literature search and review of 65 articles concerned with urban 'nature' and multispecies relations, we demonstrate a prevailing hierarchy in how, and more importantly which, nonhuman species are being represented. Parallels are noted from recent social movements and the work of scholars from complementary fields. We highlight the dangers posed by this selective remit of care and concern and suggest critical animal studies as a way to adjust the frame and extend the boundaries of dominant thinking about what constitutes 'nature'. In conclusion, we call for researchers concerned with urban nature and biodiversity to adopt more critical and repoliticized understandings of 'nature' and multispecies relations - ones that are better poised to challenge practices involving commodified animals and slow the pace of environmental destructions and losses they are associated with.

TI Towards urban resilience through Sustainable Drainage Systems: A
   multi-objective optimisation problem
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The necessity of incorporating a resilience-informed approach into urban planning and its decision-making is felt now more than any time previously, particularly in low and middle income countries. In order to achieve a successful transition to sustainable, resilient and cost-effective cities, there is a growing attention given to more effective integration of nature-based solutions, such as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), with other urban components. The experience of SuDS integration with urban planning, in developed cities, has proven to be an effective strategy with a wide range of advantages and lower costs. The effective design and implementation of SuDS requires a multi-objective approach by which all four pillars of SuDS design (i.e., water quality, water quantity, amenity and biodiversity) are considered in connection to other urban, social, and economic aspects and constraints. This study develops a resilience-driven multi-objective optimisation model aiming to provide a Pareto-front of optimised solutions for effective incorporation of SuDS into (peri)urban planning, applied to a case study in Brazil. This model adopts the SuDS's two pillars of water quality and water quantity as the optimisation objectives with its level of spatial distribution as decision variables. Also, an improved quality of life index (iQoL) is developed to re-evaluate the optimal engineering solutions to encompass the amenity and biodiversity pillars of SuDS. Rain barrels, green roofs, bio-retention tanks, vegetation grass swales and permeable pavements are the suitable SuDS options identified in this study. The findings show that the most resilient solutions are costly but this does not guarantee higher iQoL values. Bio-retention tanks and grass swales play effective roles in promotion of water quality resilience but this comes with considerable increase in costs. Permeable pavements and green roofs are effective strategies when flood resilience is a priority. Rain barrel is a preferred solution due to the dominance of residential areas in the study area and the lower cost of this option.

TI Synthetic ecosystems: an emerging opportunity for science and society?
SO OIKOS
AB For millenia, humans have modified aspects of natural ecosystems to meet their social, economic and ecological needs. With advancing technology and global movement of species, modification has shifted to designing and creating new ecologies in cityscapes, building interiors, agricultural settings and more. We call intentional ecosystems that combine biodiversity and technology with little to no shared history, synthetic ecosystems. Fields, from microbial ecology to agroecology, build synthetic ecosystems under different names but share the same properties of: Being human-designed, assembled and controlled, having novel components and/or interactions, and creating systems distinctly different from what came before at a site. Creating synthetic ecosystems represents a design challenge, but also an opportunity for real-world impact - which we illustrate with a biodiverse, indoor synthetic ecosystem for food production. Overall, synthetic ecosystems may advance socioecological goals in six ways. They can: 1) replace ecological deadzones with living systems (e.g. building green roofs), 2) enhance existing ecosystem processes (e.g. boosting agricultural yields), 3) create new ecosystem functions (e.g. bioelectricity), 4) establish new ecosystem controls (e.g. biological control), 5) foster knowledge synthesis (e.g. testing ecological theory) and 6) reshape human-nature relationships (e.g. improve wellbeing). To realize these potentials, future work must more fully evaluate whereandwhen synthetic ecosystems are appropriate to build, whatarchitectures and aspects of diversity (biological and technological) make them most functional and how knowledge from across cultures and eras can be integrated in solutions.

TI Establishment and development of ornamental grasses on green roofs and
   living walls
SO LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Ornamental grasses are often used in gardens to improve biodiversity and as additional aesthetical resources. However, their use in green roofs (GR) and living walls (LW) is not so widespread and it has not been studied extensively. The aim of this work is to assess the performance of seven grass species (Imperata cylindrica 'Red Baron', Acorus gramineus, Stipa tenuissima 'Pony Fails', Carex flagellifera 'Bronzita', Carex oshimensis 'Evergold', Uncinia rubra 'Everflame' and Miscanthus sinensis) for their use in GR and LW. The growth of the plants was evaluated (i.e. biomass production, dimensions), as well as their visual quality and survival. C. flagellifera and C. oshimensis showed coverage levels greater than 75% and good visual quality, while A. gramineus reached 55-60%. I. cylindrica and M. sinensis showed coverages slightly below 50% in the LW, however, both performed well in the GR, though with a lower visual quality. U. rubra did not develop well, reaching the lowest coverage (below 45%) but maintaining a high visual quality. S. tenuissima also attained low coverage in the LW and presented high mortality, especially in the GR. In LW, C. oshimensis stood out in flowering, while S. tenuissima showed the highest flowering rate in GR. The species should be selected considering their characteristics and performance in order to achieve a correct appearance and development. Interspecific interactions are especially important in LW, as species with upward growth should be placed above species with fallen leaves, not below.

TI The Influence of Mixed Green Covers, a New Trend in Organic Olive
   Growing, on the Efficiency of Predatory Insects
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Intensive soil tillage and the resulting erosion constitutes one of the main problems in olive growing. Palliative practices such as implementing vegetable covers are encouraged. Recently, the method of adding inert green roofs to the soil, either alone or in combination with adventitious vegetation, has stood out. Assessing this agronomic measure is our main objective. This research was conducted in 2022 in the Jaen province (southern Spain), wherein olive groves with different managements were selected: (i) conventional, free from vegetation, (ii) ecologically managed olive grove containing a cover of adventitious vegetation (VC), and (iii) ecologically managed olive grove in which the remains of pruning are added to the adventitious cover (VC-MIX). Vegetation inventories and beneficial insect monitoring were performed using a combined device with chromatic and olfactory trapping. The olive moth (Prays oleae) and lacewing predators were selected as the indicator species. Both the beneficial insect diversity and relative plant abundance were higher in the VC-MIX, where the highest rates of predation by lacewings were found (88%). In turn, these parameters in the VC olive surpassed those of the conventional olive grove. The factors involved in the notable differences between the three management types are discussed.

TI The effects of growth form on the impact of companion planting of
   nectar-producing plant species with <i>Sedum album</i> for extensive
   green roofs
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Pollinators provide crucial urban ecosystem services. Introducing nectar-producing species on green roofs is one method to support pollinator populations. However, novel cultivation methods may be required to improve plant health with minimal irrigation on extensive green roofs, which are severely restricted in soil thickness. Although companion planting with CAM plants such as Sedum has been reported to improve the performance of neighboring plants, the growth form of the beneficiary species seems important in determining the effectiveness of the technique. In this study, eleven species of nectar-producing plants were classified into two growth forms: carpet species (Phyla canescens, Trifolium repens, Thymus serpyllum and Thymus longicaulis), non-carpet species (Calamintha nepeta, Lavandula officinalis, Lavandula stoechas, Melissa officinalis, Mimosa pudica, Rosmarinus officinalis 'Erectus', Rosmarinus officinalis 'Prostratus'), and were planted together with Sedum albumin a greenhouse or on a rooftop space. There were no net positive effects in the impacts of companion planting with S. album on plant biomass both in carpet and non-carpet species. However, companion planting with S. album had net positive effects on leaf health in L. stoechas, M. officinalis, M. pudica, and R. officinalis 'Prostratus', classified as non-carpet species. In contrast, there were no positive effects on carpet species, planted together with S. album. These results suggest that complementary growth forms could be one of the factors to determine effective planting combinations to improve plant health conditions on extensive green roofs. Additionally, the increase in soil water content by suppressing evapotranspiration when water is limiting can be effective in improving leaf health conditions of neighbors in companion planting with S. album. While past studies have shown positive benefits of companion planting with CAM species, this experiment suggests the possibility that not all growth forms may benefit from facilitation by Sedum.

TI Resilient plant species selection for urban green infrastructure
   development in arid regions: a case of Qom, Iran
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB In regard to the ecological challenges stand facing green infrastructure in hot-arid regions, selecting resilient species of plants, as a determining factor, can significantly contribute to GI sustainability. Therefore, the present study aimed to establish a framework for the selection of resilient plant species in these regions, particularly in the city of Qom, Central Iran. To this end, the main criteria were ascertained based on the related thematic literature. Then, any existing (dominant) and proposed species exploited for the development of GI in this region were identified. In the following, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the fuzzy AHP to assign weight to each criterion, and the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution were utilized to rank the plant species. For this purpose, the opinions of 15 experts in urban GI and horticulture were elicited. The results demonstrated that water (0.273), soil (0.254), climate (0.199), ecological conditions (0.180), and urban pollution (0.092) were the main determining criteria. As well, resistance of the plant species against soil salinity (0.075), evapotranspiration (ET) (0.069), water stress (0.3067), salinity (0.067), and adverse environmental conditions (0.063) were among the most significant sub-criteria to clarify the resilient species concerned. Finally, it was concluded that tree species such as Tamarix aphylla, and Populus euphratica (desert poplar), Eucalyptus blue (southern blue gum); shrub ones including Calligonum, Callistemon citrinus (crimson bottlebrush), and Astragalus brachycalyx (the Persian manna); and vegetation species such as Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary), Frankenia (sea heath), and Atriplex argentea were the most resilient species.

TI Rewilding in the Garden: are garden hybrid plants (cultivars) less
   resilient to the effects of hydrological extremes than their parent
   species? A case study with <i>Primula</i>
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Urban green infrastructure, such as gardens, can mitigate some of the consequences of climate change, e.g. reducing flash-flooding or urban heat islands. Green infrastructure, however, may itself be vulnerable to a changing climate, and not all garden and landscape plant taxa will remain viable under weather scenarios predicted for the future. It has been suggested that cultivated forms of garden plants (hybrids and selected varieties) particularly, will be susceptible to enhanced stress associated with more frequent flooding, drought and rapid oscillations between these hydrological extremes; thus potentially limiting the range of taxa that can be used in gardens in the future. This research explored this concept by evaluating cultivated forms of the common garden plant - Primula, and testing whether these were less resilient to the effects of hydrological extremes than their progenitor species, Primula vulgaris. The results support this hypothesis and demonstrated that cultivated taxa were more susceptible to the hydrological stresses imposed than Primula vulgaris. Interestingly though, those cultivars that superficially resembled the parent species (Primula 'Cottage Cream') showed more stress tolerance than others with larger or more ornamental flowers, suggesting a 'gradient of susceptibility' within the hybrids. The notion that the most flamboyant cultivars are sacrificing stress tolerance for traits linked with aesthetics is discussed. The data, albeit on one genus only, has implications for the design of gardens/ornamental landscapes for the future and calls for more attention within breeding programmes to enhance abiotic stress tolerance within garden and landscape plants.

TI <i>Echium vulgare</i> and <i>Echium plantagineum</i>: A Comparative
   Study to Evaluate Their Inclusion in Mediterranean Urban Green Roofs
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green roofs (GRs) are proposed to offset against numerous environmental and socio-economic concerns associated with climate change and urban sprawl. In Mediterranean urban areas, to protect and conserve biodiversity through GRs, the use of native plant species from arid environments and with shallow roots is generally recommended. In north Europe, Echium vulgare L. is widely used on GRs for its tolerance to abiotic stresses and its attractiveness for bees; unfortunately, since this species requires cold winters to induce flowering and warm wet summers for vegetative growths, its adaptability to Mediterranean GRs has been questioned. The current study is based on the hypothesis that Echium plantagineum L. can adapt better to the Mediterranean environment than E. vulgare and offer blooms to pollinators, thus providing the important urban ecosystem service (UES) of protecting entomofauna biodiversity. To compare the adaptability of E. plantagineum vs. E. vulgare, both Echium species were grown and studied on the extensive GR installed at ENEA Casaccia Research Center, in the north of Rome, Lazio, Italy. The comparative analysis of the GR performance of the two species was based on several plant-related traits, including seed morphology, rosette stage, inflorescence, flower and root-related traits, and their biological life cycle, most of them showing significant differences (for example, rosette area was 1.42-fold major in E. plantagineum than in E. vulgare). The information provided in this manuscript will be useful to update the herbarium records for conservation biology. A dramatic water stress was purposely applied in the GR before the end of the hot summer season, and while E. plantagineum faced with success the imposed dehydration (88.4% vegetation cover), E. vulgare did not (7.5% vegetation cover), presumably because of its biennial life cycle which did not allow it to complete seed maturation (only 46.9% percentage mature seeds in E. vulgare respect to 89.5% in E. plantagineum). In summary, as the main result, this work shows that in Mediterranean areas, the inclusion of E. plantagineum in seed mixes for flower meadow GRs could represent a valuable alternative to E. vulgare in temperate areas, providing a safeguard for pollinators and allowing water and energy saving.

TI The New Green Challenge in Urban Planning: The Right Genetics in the
   Right Place
SO HORTICULTURAE
AB The creation of green areas within urban centers was born as a response to profoundly different problems, such as the demographic increase and the progressive urbanization of landscapes. Moreover, up to date, the genetics of plants has not been considered for urban contexts. The purpose of this review is to discuss the state of the art and the advantages in planning genetic improvement for plants for urban destinations, also providing technical information, that may contribute in a concrete way. Firstly, recent genomic sources and their potential contribution to breeding programs are discussed. Then, dividing the urban scenarios into four macro areas (i.e., urban/metropolitan parks, urban gardens, road verges and roofs/terraces/balconies), we described the role of genetics in the adaptability and sustainability of plants in these different contexts. In addition, we analyzed the genetic traits plants need to provide services for a city environment and population (e.g., pollution reduction, biodiversity conservation, soil stability, and food production).

TI Public support for urban climate adaptation policy through nature-based
   solutions in Prague
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB Climate change is an urgent challenge in urban planning. Weather extremes and resulting impacts such as heat waves and flash floods are already influencing the quality of life in cities and impact on infrastructure, human health and city life. In this study, we investigated perception of and economic preferences for adaptation to climate change in one of Europe's capital cities to inform its planning policy. Through a choice experiment, we elicit the preferences of a sample (n = 550) from Prague, Czech Republic, for a citywide policy which would increase the use of six commonly used nature-based solutions (NBS) in public spaces and on public buildings across the city. Three attributes were used to describe this policy: (i) the locations where NBS would predominantly be implemented, (ii) the species diversity of these measures, and (iii) their implied costs for households. Our results showed that the NBS policy is widely supported by the public over the status quo and that this preference is mirrored in citizens' concerns about climate change and the risks posed by heatwaves particularly. Species diversity matters in the portrayed scenarios, suggesting that (bio)diverse NBS generate additional public value over single species measures and that policy which targets biodiversity may gain support. Implementation of NBS in public spaces (e.g., street trees, rain gardens) is preferred over measures implemented on public buildings (green roofs and facades). Furthermore, adverse experiences with heatwaves has increased support for the policy. The presented results provide evidence that adaptation planning through NBS is likely to generate significant public value which is expected to increase with the intensifying effects of climate change.

TI Plant Colonization of Green Roofs Is Affected by Composition of
   Established Native Plant Communities
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Human activities associated with urbanization have negatively affected the biodiversity of native plant communities globally. Establishing native species assemblages on green roofs may help conserve native plant diversity in urban areas, but these assemblages are susceptible to colonization by species from the surrounding landscape. In natural communities, colonization from the regional species pool reflects the filtering effects of both abiotic and biotic factors, but the relative effects of these factors on green roof colonization are not well-understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied colonization dynamics of 10 green roofs in New York City (NY, United States), each established at the same time with the same source materials. On each roof, 12 plots were established, with one-half of each plot planted with an erect C-4 graminoid dominant (Hempstead Plains: HP) and the other half with a tuft C-3 graminoid and forb dominant (Rocky Summit: RS) species assemblage derived from native communities. Six of the 12 split-plots contained shallow growing medium, while the other six contained deeper growing medium. Resident plants were planted in October 2010. Fifty-eight non-resident plant species colonized plots between August 2011 and August 2012, with two native and 10 non-native species accounting for 90% of total colonist dry mass. Colonist dry mass and richness decreased with increasing resident plant cover, but the effects of growing medium depth on colonist dry mass and richness differed between assemblages. Forbs accounted for 81% of the colonist dry mass from the HP assemblage, but just 31% in the RS assemblage. Further, forbs accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in June and July, while graminoids accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in August. These results indicate colonization of planted green roofs may be strongly affected by the composition of established plant assemblages and that these effects may vary temporally with colonist management regime, even within a single growing season. Further, the inconsistent effects of growing medium depth suggest that niche overlap and complementarity in rhizosphere dynamics may influence colonization more in some systems compared with others. Additional research is required to describe the effects of colonist management strategies, as well as the roles of priority effects, niche complementarity and community assembly, on long-term dynamics of colonization on green roofs planted with native plants.

TI Designing Function-Specific Plant Systems for Sustainable Urban
   Development
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB Increasingly, architects are embracing "biomorphic urbanism," a design ideology that takes inspiration from nature to develop more sustainable cities that reduce the environmental impact of urban life. At the moment, plants are incorporated into biomorphic urban designs for conservation or aesthetic reasons. Here, I argue the role of plants in buildingmore sustainable cities can be augmented by integrating plant sciences, ecology, and urban design. I propose that we can develop synthetic Function-Specific Plant Systems (FSPSs) which harness the genetic and metabolic diversity of plants to performspecific services that benefit society and the environment as a whole. FSPSs can contribute to three broad categories of urban life: Urban Landscape and Infrastructure; Biodiversity and the Environment; and Human Health. Across the three categories, FSPSs can be designed to provide nine key services: flood control, soil stabilization, fire control, climate control, water treatment, habitat for endangered flora and fauna, pest control, air purification, and modulation of human immune systems. The plants included in each FSPS are based on several considerations, including (1) functional traits, (2) biogeography, and (3) cultural concerns. In the future, synthetic biology could improve, expand and diversify these services. This approach harnesses plant biodiversity to transform urban spaces while meeting key UN Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Innovative module of expanded cork agglomerate for green vertical
   systems
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Green vertical systems (GVSs) can offer several benefits, both for buildings by increasing their thermal and acoustic insulation, and for the urban environment by enhancing the biodiversity, improving the air quality, and reducing the heat island effect. Despite all these benefits, the effective sustainability of these systems has been questioned when assessed from a life cycle perspective. This is largely because of the environmental impacts related to the components and materials used in the construction of such solutions, but also due to irrigation and maintenance needs.
   In this work, the authors describe the design process for a new modular GVS based on insulation cork boards (ICBs). A comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) of several GVSs was first carried out to identify the environmental hotspots of most concern related to the product phase. Based on the conclusions of the LCA and a set of additional functional requirements, the authors then proposed a new ICB module to build a GVS with better environmental performance. Since ICBs can be produced with different mass densities, with distinct environmental impacts and manufacturing costs, a full mechanical characterization was also carried out to assist in choosing the most suitable ICB density.
   The results suggest that ICB modules of medium density (140-160 kg/m(3)) can be an appropriate eco-friendlier alternative to current plasticand metal-based GVSs, fully complying with the environmental and functional requirements that would be expected for a living wall system.

TI Remote sensing for assessing vegetated roofs with a new replicable
   method in Paris, France
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB Vegetated roofs provide many ecosystem services and support urban biodiversity. While it would be interesting to study the contribution of vegetated roofs to ecological corridors, vegetated roofs are listed in no French databases. Because of their intrinsic nature as roofs, their small number, their small size, and the type of vegetation planted on them, vegetated roofs seem to be very difficult to identify. We propose a method to automatically identify vegetated roofs. Using infrared aerial photographs and building shape data, we were able to build a model detecting vegetated roofs using remote sensing and supervised classification techniques. The major difficulty lies in distinguishing between real vegetated roofs and roofs partially covered by tree foliage growing on the ground. In this operation, our classification model obtains an error rate of similar to 18%. We improve the knowledge of vegetation detection in cities. Moreover, it opens interesting perspectives on the analysis of ecological networks in cities as a function of building height. In addition, it could be an interesting tool for municipalities to monitor urban vegetation development and to prioritize vegetated roofs planning.

TI Ecological performance standards for regenerative urban design
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB Ecosystem services encompass the tangible human benefits that ecosystems provide. Past efforts to maintain ecosystem services have focused on conserving and rehabilitating natural ecosystems, but there is growing consensus that the built environment must contribute these services as well. The field of regenerative design seeks to create infrastructure that contributes to and enhances local ecosystems, but a key challenge has been the development of baseline standards that reflect ecosystem health as opposed to business-as-usual design. To address this challenge, we draw on work by Biomimicry 3.8 and project partners to outline a framework for ecological performance standards (EPS) that can be applied to regenerative projects. While current sustainability frameworks quantify negative impacts of proposed designs and seek to reduce those impacts, EPS specifies positive-impact performance standards based on local ecosystems. The EPS process involves four steps: (1) identifying a local reference ecosystem, (2) quantifying ecosystem services at the reference ecosystem to develop EPS metrics, (3) designing to meet or exceed EPS metrics at the building site, and (4) implementing and assessing the proposed design. We outline these steps in detail and provide three case studies that highlight implementation successes and challenges at the city, development, and building scale.

TI Comparing three spatial modeling tools for assessing urban ecosystem
   services
SO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB The (re)integration of nature into cities has been a progressively promoted strategy to foster sustainable urbanization. To quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by urban nature, spatially explicit ES modeling is a key method. However, particularly in absence of independent validation data, there is a clear need for multi model assessments in order to better understand uncertainties in model outcomes. Here we applied three commonly used open-source ES models (i.e., InVEST, LUCI, NC-Model) to quantify three key urban ES (i.e., local temperature regulation, flood protection and global climate regulation) using the city of The Hague (The Netherlands) as a case study. We quantified the three ES for the current situation and under two hypothetical scenarios representing changes in the amount of vegetation within the city. We found mostly positive correlations between the estimates for a given ES (Spearman's rho from 0.11 to 0.84). Yet, our comparison also revealed systematic differences in the ES indicator values between the ES models, as well as different responses to the scenarios. These differences may stem from differences in model structure (i.e., differences in biophysical processes accounted for) and model parameterization (i.e., differences in the value used to quantify a given biophysical process). To further advance urban ES modeling, we recommend i) to improve the representation of urban nature (e.g., green roofs, bioswales, gardens) and urban-specific conditions and processes (e.g., drainage systems, building patterns, soil characteristics) in urban ES models and ii) to systematically account for uncertainty in (urban) ES assessments (e.g., through multi-model assessments).

TI Overview of Green Roof Technology as a Prospective Energy Preservation
   Technique in Arid Regions
SO ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB Concerns about climate change and rising energy demands have grown as a result of fast population rise and global industrialization. The construction industry has a huge impact on the energy and environmental sectors, accounting for about 40% of global energy consumption and a large portion of overall territorial emissions. There is a need for a shift in mindset when it comes to energy usage, as well as enhanced energy efficiency approaches and radical energy efficiency initiatives. As an energy-saving solution, the green roof, also known as the living roof has suitability and environmental benefits on many levels, while also strengthening aesthetic features and provoking structural innovation. Moreover, drought-prone areas, e.g. Saudi Arabia, have significant household energy demands. The Saudi building sector consumes more than 76 % of the country's total electric power generation. As a result, the purpose of this study is to provide a general overview of living roof technology and its potential in Saudi Arabia as an energy-saving strategy. An overview of the building envelope, the impact of cladding design considerations on power usage, the benefits of a living roof, cost-benefit analysis, green policies, and examples from other countries are included in the paper. Other environmental benefits, besides the energy-saving potential of living roofs, were shown to boost the quantitative benefits of the living roof idea. A more detailed study is needed, among other things, to evaluate the energy-saving potential of living roofs based on the weather of various locations.

TI Evaluating the robustness of nature-based solutions: future resilience
   of sedum-based soft capping as a conservation approach for heritage
   sites in Britain and Ireland
SO PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB Nature-based solutions are seen to benefit both society and biodiversity. However, research into their future resilience is required. Soft capping is a nature-based conservation strategy that mimics the natural colonisation of plants on top of ruined walls and reduces rates of material deterioration. To remain effective, soft capping species must be tolerant of future climatic conditions. We use the Maxent species distribution model to assess the resilience of soft capping species to low and high emission scenarios across Britain and Ireland. We assess the mid- and end-century presence probability of four native and archaeophyte species used in soft capping (Sedum album, S. acre, S. anglicum and Saxifraga granulata). Future presence probabilities were calculated using the climate models HadGEM3-GC31-LL, IPSL-CM6A-LR and MIROC6. Results suggest that current sedum-based soft caps will remain viable until mid-century with additional maintenance (e.g. watering) during droughts, although soft caps predominantly formed of Sedum album may be prone to failure in south-eastern England. In the future, species more resilient to arid conditions may need to be preferentially selected for soft capping to ensure resilience under a warming climate. Species distribution modelling provides a useful way of predicting the future resilience of nature-based solutions.

TI Assessment of the linkage of urban green roofs, nutritional supply, and
   diversity status in Nepal
SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB Rooftop garden is growing in popularity and can be seen as a green roof for the local production of crops in urban buildings. This study focuses on the nutritionally important plants grown in the rooftop garden and their diversity index and evenness in urban roofs. A total of 103 respondents were selected randomly and interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire from the 12th of February to 23rd of May 2020. The findings suggest that the average area under rooftop gardening is 13.52% in Dhulikhel and 7.32% in Kathmandu and all of the respondents have a positive response regarding its continuation because of its multiple benefits from rooftop gardens. The plant species used for edible purposes were 43 species among the reported 91 species. The Shannon diversity index of Kathmandu was 3.58 and of Dhulikhel was 3.04. Due to lack of technical knowledge and fear of heavy load, rooftop garden in Nepal is suffering. Still, the respondents had problems regarding its management and further extension. Thus, this paper recommends the management of proper training to the growers regarding rooftop gardening, its management, and further extension and continuation. Also, much more research is necessary for developing a good crop calendar for rooftop farming.

AB This paper evaluates the use of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) measures with hydrological-hydraulic modelling and multi-criteria analysis on a case study of Girona, Spain. To assess their effectiveness for rainwater runoff reduction and consequently the reduction of combined sewer overflow (CSO) the software Giswater was employed for development of the urban catchment model. This software couples spatial data from QGIS with EPA Storm water management model (SWMM). In accordance with the conditions in the urban catchment, five scenarios were developed consisting of following SUDS measures: infiltration basins, infiltration trenches, green roofs and their combinations. These scenarios were evaluated with multi-criteria analysis based on CSO reduction, CAPEX, OPEX, amenity, biodiversity, and feasibility regarding ownership. According to the results, the scenario that included only infiltration basins was most favourable (average grade: 4.1/5), followed by the scenario which combined infiltration basins and tranches (average grade: 3.5/5).

TI Arthropod Communities on Young Vegetated Roofs Are More Similar to Each
   Other Than to Communities at Ground Level
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Vegetated roofs are human-manufactured ecosystems and potentially promising conservation tools for various taxa and habitats. Focussing on arthropods, we conducted a 3 year study on newly constructed vegetated roofs with shallow substrates (up to 10 cm) and vegetation established with pre-grown mats, plug plants and seeds to describe pioneer arthropod communities on roofs and to compare them with ground level communities. We vacuum sampled arthropods from the roofs and nearby ground level sites with low, open vegetation, i.e., potential source habitats. We showed that the roofs and ground sites resembled each other for ordinal species richness but differed in community composition: with time the roofs started to resemble each other rather than their closest ground level habitats. Species richness increased with time on roofs and at ground level, but the roofs had consistently less species than the ground sites and only a few species were unique to the roofs. Also, the proportion of predators increased on roofs, while not at ground level. We conclude that vegetated roofs established with similar substrates and vegetation, filter arthropods in a way that produces novel communities that are different from those at ground level but similar to one another. The role of these insular communities in species networks and ecosystem function remains to be investigated.

TI Adaptive strategy biases in engineered ecosystems: Implications for
   plant community dynamics and the provisioning of ecosystem services to
   people
SO PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB 1. Plant communities in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) such as biofilters play an integral role in ecosystem services provisioning, such that many design manuals now feature plant lists that guide vegetation selection. 2. This study looks at the implications of those lists for biofilter plant communities and their services, focusing on (1) how plants are selected across US climate zones, (2) whether selected plants exhibit adaptive strategy biases (i.e. towards competitive, stress tolerant or ruderal strategies that might impact ecosystem services provisioning) and (3) whether human-induced selection or natural climatic processes underly any biases revealed. 3. Our results suggest that biofilter plant strategies are significantly biased towards stress tolerance or competitiveness (depending on the climate zone) and away from ruderalness relative to the broader pool of native and wetland-adapted native species. 4. Competitive bias was evident in humid-continental climates and stress-tolerant bias in hot coastal/arid climates, with some degree of anti-ruderal bias present across all zones. 5. These biases are correlated with human concerns related to water availability and climate (water conservation; p < 0.05, irrigation; p < 0.1, climate extremes; p < 0.1). They do not appear to reflect strict climatological limits (i.e. limits that are independent of preferences or design constraints imposed by people) because they are not also evident for native plants. 6. The benefits and costs of relaxing these biases are discussed, focusing on the implications for water quality, hydrologic, and cultural services provisioning and the dynamicity of GSI ecosystems, particularly their capacity to self-repair, a prerequisite for the development of self-sustaining GSI.

TI Environmental horticulture for domestic and community gardens-An
   integrated and applied research approach
SO PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET
AB This article presents an integrated and applied research approach to the unique and multi-disciplinary area of science referred to here as environmental horticulture. It does this by: (a) providing an institutional perspective (The Royal Horticultural Society) on a research approach for this particular area, emphasising why domestic and community gardens are important in the context of global environmental threats; (b) presenting four primary research focus areas and project examples; and (c) highlighting interdisciplinary linkages, future research needs, public engagement/knowledge sharing opportunities, and 'Green Skills' development in the area of environmental horticulture. Research focus areas discussed are: (1) responding to the changing climate (adaptation, mitigation and resilience solutions in gardens); (2) 'plants for purpose' (harnessing the potential of horticultural plant diversity, and gardening, to help regulate environmental conditions); (3) sustainability and climate risk reduction through effective and efficient resource management (reduction, re-use, recycling and repurposing); and (4) gardening and cultivated plant choice for human health and wellbeing. We argue that a key research priority is improving our understanding of the linkages and interactions between soil, water, plants, weather and people. These crucial linkages affect above and below ground processes, for both outdoor and indoor plants. They impact the effectiveness with which water and nutrient cycling takes place, the extent to which ecosystem services may be delivered, and the resultant capacity of gardens and gardening to provide environmental and human health benefits.

AB We live in the knowledge of the present as a limit in time, and our choices should guarantee for future generations the same opportunities for the enjoyment of resources. We are currently realizing just to what extent our landscapes, as a product of multiple factors, are likely to disappear due to climate change. Global warming, the consequent risk of drought and flood and the disappearance of biodiversity are all factors that refer to issues that are not only local but which are also linked to international and global policies.
   Copenaghen, London, Paris and Singapore have already taken steps to reduce carbon emissions through an urban greening policy with parks and roofs, but also with the urban agriculture development.
   According to the index that assesses the vulnerability of countries subject to the effects of global warming in 2015, the Climate Change Vulnerability Index, Bangladesh is among those most exposed, so that it has been estimated that within just over thirty years, over forty million people could lose their livelihood as well as their homes.
   These problems are not insignificant, but they remain tantalizing because of the prospects they raise. The debate is much broader than can be summarized here because there are so many factors involved. However, it must be said that even the smallest action is of great value, by giving importance to a new way of studying the landscape, with regards to its impoverishment and lost equilibrium, that stimulates the search for new concrete and real solutions that will satisfy everyone.

TI Assessing stormwater control measures using modelling and a

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents a methodology for assessing the selection of stormwater control measures (SCM) within an urban drainage system that combines hydrological-hydraulic modelling and multi-criteria analysis (MCA). The methodology's utility is illustrated on urban catchment in the city of Girona, Spain. The SWMM model was applied and calibrated to simulate SCM scenarios. Seven scenarios were evaluated consisting of one grey infrastructure measure using underground storage tank and three nature-based SCM i.e. infiltration basins, infiltration trenches, green roofs, and combinations thereof. These scenarios were evaluated with MCA including combined sewer overflow (CSO) reduction, CAPEX, OPEX, amenity, biodiversity, and feasibility regarding ownership. The results show that the scenario that included only infiltration basins was most favourable, followed by the scenario which combined infiltration basins and trenches. The underground storage tank was the least favourable with the lowest grade, due to high CAPEX and OPEX, and due to single functionality.

TI Alkaline habitat for vegetated roofs? Ecosystem dynamics in a vegetated
   roof with crushed concrete-based substrate
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Using local and recycled materials is a sustainable way to establish a vegetated roof. In order to understand how the roof ecosystem functions and returns ecosystem services, it is important to study vegetation, soil organisms and runoff quality. We established a vegetated roof experiment based on a substrate containing lightweight crushed concrete, an alkaline side product from a concrete factory, mixed with compost. This five-year experiment in southern Finland tested how planting method (pre-grown vegetation mats vs. pot planting), compost content (20% vs. 40%, fresh volume), and substrate depth affect the cover and diversity of plants, the abundance of soil animals and the quality of runoff. Although the substrate had a high pH (7.3-11.8), many vascular plants were able to survive and establish viable populations. The planting method had a strong effect on plant diversity and the cover of individual species because the vegetation mats became dominated by the invasive, non-native Phedimus hybridus. Establishment with pot plants in turn provided bare ground that was colonised by spontaneous non-invasive species. This resulted in higher diversity, and a more even distribution of species. The amount of compost had only a weak impact on vegetation, whereas high pH generally reduced plant abundance and diversity. The concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in runoff were low as compared to values reported from many other vegetated roofs, were not affected by compost content and decreased over time. In summary, the high-pH substrate based on recycled materials is an environmentally responsible choice, suitable for a wide variety of plants, even rare and endangered species.

TI Experimental comparison of two extensive green roof designs in Northwest
   Mexico
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Accelerated population growth and urbanization have negative environmental impacts, such as habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, natural resource depletion, and pollution. They speed up climate change, contribute to urban heat islands, and increase energy use. Green roofs (GRs) can reduce the ecological footprint and improve the quality of life within cities but require careful design for best results. This study analyzes the thermal performance of GRs in six experimental modules differing in roof cover: concrete, reflective coating, dry soil, wet soil, traditional GR with Sedum acre, and wetland GR with Salicornia pacifica. The two plant species have different carbon assimilation metabolisms: S. pacifica is a native wetland C3 species with diurnal transpiration that grows in flooded soils, and S. acre is an exotic Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) species with night-time transpiration, commonly used in GRs. GRs were monitored during the winter of 2020 in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, a city with a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. We found that vegetated covers reduced the temperature oscillation with an insulating effect. During the warmest week, they reduced the internal roof surface temperature (Ts,in) up to 12.4 degrees C in comparison to the concrete roof. They maintained Ts,in up to 5.8 degrees C warmer than concrete roof during the coldest week, indicating that GRs are efficient thermal regulators in this region, potentially reducing buildings' thermal load as well as providing additional ecosystemic services. Since S. pacifica had higher survival and coverage, we recommend its use in GRs located in Northwest Mexico and climatically similar world regions.

TI Vegetated roofs in boreal climate support mobile open habitat
   arthropods, with differentiation between meadow and succulent roofs
SO URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

TI Willingness to Pay for Green Infrastructure in Residential Development-A
   Consumer Perspective
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB This paper investigates the literature and theoretical underpinning of the concept of "willingness to pay" (WTP) for green infrastructure (GI) with consequences for residential development. The benefits of GI in urban settlements include improved air quality, attenuation of the urban heat island, thermal insulation and lower energy bills for green roofs and walls, the creation of social amenity space, a habitat for biodiversity, and stormwater water attenuation. Collectively, these benefits are termed eco-system services and enhance sustainability. The role of GI, the "lungs of the planet", is heavily correlated to atmospheric conditions; high levels of GI improve air quality, which is acknowledged widely with many cities increasing GI to make them more resilient to future predicted challenges with respect to heat and poor air quality. In addition, there is evidence that the biophilia effect enhances human well-being. There are some studies claiming that purchasers pay a premium for property with good GI. However, there is little research about the process in consumers' minds leading to such a premium-if, how, when (under what circumstances), and then to what extent are consumers willing to pay for GI. This process, if better understood, may enable sellers or policy makers to influence the amounts of GI in developments, thus making it possible to enhance the value of GI to buyers. There is some research pointing to factors to be considered when modeling such processes. For developers, knowing the optimum amount of GI would enable them to design and construct developments with maximum purchaser appeal. To do this, stakeholders need to predict the level of WTP amongst potential purchasers for which they need to understand the decision processes behind WTP. In this way, sustainability in residential property development could be optimized. The paper analyzes the literature and theories concerning WTP, focusing on dwellings and GI. Our findings are that some quantitative evidence exists that purchasers pay more for residential property with high levels of GI in some cities, but they do so without any understanding of the possible decision processes leading to those premiums (if, how, when, and then to what extent). The paper proposes a comprehensive conceptual model that may explain buyers' WTP for a dwelling based on a presumed cost-benefit analysis performed by buyers, which has been extended here to include GI and psychological factors. Thus, the paper has a consumer perspective. The model may be used to select variables and test them in empirical studies, and by integrating with other factors in the model, it can attain a more comprehensive understanding of WTP for GI in residential development.

TI Innovating with Nature: From Nature-Based Solutions to Nature-Based

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Nature-based solutions (NBS) to address societal challenges have been widely recognised and adopted by governments in climate change and biodiversity strategies. Nevertheless, significant barriers exist for the necessary large-scale implementation of NBS and market development is still in its infancy. This study presents findings from a systematic review of literature and a survey on private sector agents in the planning and implementation of NBS, with the aim to identify them. In this study, we propose a typology for organisations delivering NBS and a categorisation of their economic activities. The most common organisation type found is nature-based enterprise which offers products or services where nature is a core element and used sustainably and engages in economic activity. Moreover, eleven categories of economic activities were identified, ranging from ecosystem restoration, living green roofs, and eco-tourism to smart technologies and community engagement for NBS. Nature-based enterprises contribute to a diverse range of sustainable economic activities, that standard industry classification systems do not adequately account for. The recognition of the value created by these activities is essential for designing effective policy support measures, and for market development of the sector and its potential to facilitate the wider adoption of NBS.

TI Hypotheses in urban ecology: building a common knowledge base
SO BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB Urban ecology is a rapidly growing research field that has to keep pace with the pressing need to tackle the sustainability crisis. As an inherently multi-disciplinary field with close ties to practitioners and administrators, research synthesis and knowledge transfer between those different stakeholders is crucial. Knowledge maps can enhance knowledge transfer and provide orientation to researchers as well as practitioners. A promising option for developing such knowledge maps is to create hypothesis networks, which structure existing hypotheses and aggregate them according to topics and research aims. Combining expert knowledge with information from the literature, we here identify 62 research hypotheses used in urban ecology and link them in such a network. Our network clusters hypotheses into four distinct themes: (i) Urban species traits & evolution, (ii) Urban biotic communities, (iii) Urban habitats and (iv) Urban ecosystems. We discuss the potentials and limitations of this approach. All information is openly provided as part of an extendable Wikidata project, and we invite researchers, practitioners and others interested in urban ecology to contribute additional hypotheses, as well as comment and add to the existing ones. The hypothesis network and Wikidata project form a first step towards a knowledge base for urban ecology, which can be expanded and curated to benefit both practitioners and researchers.

TI Biophilic design in architecture and its contributions to health,
   well-being, and sustainability: A critical review
SO FRONTIERS OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH
AB In the last ten years, 'nature' and biophilic design have received widespread attention in architecture, especially in response to growing environmental challenges. However, open questions and controversies remain regarding conceptualizing and addressing 'nature' in practice and research. This study conducts a literature review to discuss biophilic design as a theoretical framework to interpret 'nature' in architecture. The following questions are answered: (1) How has the concept of biophilic design emerged, and how can it be defined? (2) In what ways can biophilic design contribute to the goals of sustainable architecture? (3) What are the key design strategies in biophilic design? This review identifies and compares the key frameworks of biophilic design and explains their major elements. We then analyse the benefits (e.g., enhance health, well-being, productivity, biodiversity, and circularity) of biophilic design in achieving sustainability, as framed through the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The results indicate that biophilic design is more complex and richer than the mere application of vegetation in buildings; it broadens the variety through encompassing different types of nature from physical, sensory, metaphorical, morphological, material to spiritual. Moreover, knowledge gaps are identified to motivate future research and critical reflections on biophilic design practices. (C) 2021 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

TI Evaluation of ecosystem services of rooftop gardens in Dhaka, Bangladesh
SO CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Urbanization is continually taking place in the cities. Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital and the world's 11th largest megacity, is no exception to this trend. Cities relying on natural ecosystems outside the city boundaries also benefit from internal urban ecosystems as well. Rooftop gardens have the potential to be excellent urban ecosystem stimulators and play a significant role in urban landscape planning and management. An experimental survey was conducted on twenty rooftop gardens from two metropolitan areas (Mohammadpur and Dhanmondi) of Dhaka city. The goal was to examine the four categories of ecosystem services: Provisioning, supporting, regulating and cultural, supplied by ecosystems within the Rooftop Gardens (RTGs) and to evaluate their performances by examining through a Rapid Assessment Checklist (RAC) tool. The RAC was consisted of 47 proxy indicators (33 qualitative and 14 quantitative indicators) directly or indirectly representing various dimensions of ecosystem services. From a maximum of 100, the average score of total ecosystem services was 50 +/- 12 which could be considered as an intermediate performance in ecosystem services provision. The highest score 60 +/- 14 was obtained from the cultural services and the lowest score 41 +/- 13 was from provisioning services. The assessment of RTGES would allow stakeholders to identify the weak and strong points of the existing rooftop gardens for their management and improvement. A proper understanding of RTGES and integrated participation of gardeners and urban planners could contribute to designing ecosystem service based roof gardens for making human settlements ecologically sustainable.

CY MAY 04-06, 2022

AB Our planet is rapidly urbanizing, leading to significant biodiversity loss. In architecture and urban planning, public and private developers are beginning to integrate vegetation into built environments such as green roofs, urban farms, and bioremediation systems, in some cases designed as novel additions to mechanical systems. In indoor environments, investigations into active biofilters for improving Indoor Air Quality have been investigated for several decades. As much of this research remains in disparate fields of inquiry and examines specific aspects of the indoor ecosystem, there are still many gaps in the knowledge, leaving building design professionals without comprehensive or standard frameworks to make actionable decisions on their anticipated performance. The value of such bioremediation systems, as well as the reliability of the evidence at the scale necessary to advocate for them, has often been obfuscated by the extrapolation of chamber-scale results with narrow scopes to the more complex contextual factors present with whole building matrix behaviors. To establish more systematic frameworks for evaluating building-integrated bioremediation and vegetation systems, shifting towards more comprehensive Indoor Environmental Quality metrics suggests a broader, more inclusive range of evaluative criteria at scale, towards multivalent value propositions. In addition to airborne pollutant removal rates, the impact of vegetation systems on a range of factors such as acoustic and thermal performance, allows for a more pragmatic and comprehensive assessment of value. Additional methods of evaluation including life-cycle analysis (energy, water, material use), potential health benefits (diverse microbiome, biophilia, etc), and other stakeholder frameworks (ecosystem services, etc) or value systems could offer more holistic performance metrics through which to evaluate systems. Evolving frameworks capable of integrating disparate metrics are necessary to (1) direct fundamental research towards more applicable experimental reporting values, and (2) provide accessible frameworks for decision makers when considering indoor vegetation systems.

TI Stormwater ponds: An overlooked but plentiful urban designer ecosystem
   provides invasive plant habitat in a subtropical region (Florida, USA)
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Designed ecosystems are built as part of ongoing urban expansion, providing a suite of valued ecosystem services. However, these new ecosystems could also promote disservices by facilitating the colonization and spread of invasive species. We conduct the first assessment of the quantity and invasion of an overlooked designed ecosystem: stormwater ponds. These ponds are commonly recommended for managing urban hydrology, but little is known about their ecology or extent of proliferation. Using a broad-scale survey of pond coverage in Florida, USA, we found that over 76,000 stormwater ponds have been built just in this state, forming 2.7% of total urban land cover. This extensive pondscape of manufactured habitats could facilitate species spread throughout urban areas and into nearby natural waterbodies. We also conducted a survey of the severity of plant invasion in 30 ponds in Gainesville, FL, US across two pond types (dry vs. wet), and a gradient of management intensities (low, medium, high) and pond ages. We unexpectedly found a high number of invasive plant species (28 in just 30 ponds). Ninety-six percent of surveyed ponds contained from one to ten of these species, with ponds exhibiting high turnover in invader composition (i.e., high beta diversity). The bank sections of dry unmanaged ponds exhibited the highest mean invasive species richness (5.8 +/- 1.3) and the inundated centers of wet medium managed ponds exhibited the highest mean invasive species cover (34 +/- 12%). Invasive plant richness and cover also tended to be greater in dry ponds with higher soil nutrient levels, and in older wet ponds. Therefore, we found that highly maintained and younger wet ponds were the least invaded. Nevertheless, common management practices that limit plant invasions may also limit native species establishment and invasion may increase in the decades following pond construction.
