Recent trends in green roof biodiversity research: a five-year bibliometric review - RAW DATASETS

**Data Source**
Web of Science (WoS) 

**Data Reuse Plan**
This document provides metadata for the project dataset derived from textual and bibliometric analyses of green roof research. 
The dataset encompasses various aspects, including terminology trends, prolific authors, leading journals, global engagement, citation metrics, and contributing organizations.

**Description** 
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of green roof research trends from 2003 to 2023, with a specific focus on biodiversity studies in the last five years. The dataset is derived from 4,743 scientific articles obtained through Web of Science, employing automated content analysis and bibliometric approaches.

**Location**
Global, sourced from international green roof research articles, conference proceedings, book chapters

**Temporal Coverage**
2003-2023

**Publication Date**
Dec 9th, 2023 data pulled and exported from WoS as plain text (.txt) and referencing  (.ris)

**Data Collection Process**
4,743 articles were extracted from WoS. For biodiversity focus, a subset of 178 articles from the last five years was created. VOSviewer facilitated bibliometric analysis and visualization, providing insights into term co-occurrence and authorship networks.

**Data Processing**
Data cleaning involved natural language processing using VOSviewer and manual relevance checks. The final dataset is presented in tables, network visualizations and thematic clusters.

**File  Format**
.txt format for main corpus and subset, VOSviewer visualizations available.
Variables:
Abstract (Terms), Authors, Journals, Countries, Institutions.

**Project Goals**
1. Identify key research themes and clusters.
2. Uncover trends in green roof research.
3. Explore biodiversity-related studies.
4. Contribute to the understanding of sustainable urban practices.

**Expected Impact**
Enhanced understanding of green roof research landscape, identification of key contributors, and recognition of common themes in the field.
